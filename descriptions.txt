Dr. Aaronson is actively engaged in clinical practice and clinical research in the areas of heart failure, heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support. His research has focused on improving health, quality of life and economic outcomes in these populations, utilizing methodologies ranging from small to large scale observational analyses, Markov modeling, meta-analyses, and both industry-sponsored and investigator-initiated randomized clinical trials of standard pharmaceutical interventions, alternative medicines, patient education and mechanical circulatory support. Dr. Aaronson has had a particular interest in modeling outcomes in advanced heart failure, heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support to inform appropriate utilization of health resources. We are conducting a project to deploy Natural Language Processing to analyze clinicians' progress notes from Electronic Health Records and identify healthcare-related features that determine Failure To Rescue (Death after a major complication) among cardiac surgery patients. Another project that I would like to highlight is the project where we assessed the relationship between intraoperative surgeons' non-technical skills (situation awareness, decision-making, leadership, communication, and teamwork) and patient outcomes. During this project, we observed surgeons and used validated tools to measure their non-technical skills. We thereafter calculated the relationship between surgeons' non-technical skills and risk-adjusted complications. We found that higher surgeons' non-technical skills scores were associated with decreased mortality risk and reoperation. Our next steps include using ML/AI to develop objective measures to assess surgeons' non-technical skills from intraoperative audio and video recordings. I would like to contribute to the field of implementation science by deploying ML/AI to identify critical features determinants of successful implementation of evidence-based interventions to improve the quality of patient care. Dr. Abney has pursued research in natural language understanding and natural language learning, including information extraction, biomedical text processing, integrating text analysis into web search, robust and rapid partial parsing, stochastic grammars, spoken-language information systems, extraction of linguistic information from scanned page images, dependency-grammar induction for low-resource languages, and semisupervised learning. In this project, we use multi-scale models coupled with machine learning algorithms to study cardiac electromechanic coupling. The approach spans out the molecular, Brownian, and Langevin dynamics of the contractile (sarcomeric proteins) mechanism of cardiac cells and up-to-the finite element analysis of the tissue and organ levels. In this work, a novel surrogate machine learning algorithm for the sarcomere contraction is developed. The model is trained and established using in-silico data-driven dynamic sampling procedures implemented using our previously derived myofilament mathematical models. Multi-scale Machine Learning Modeling of Cardiac Electromechanics Coupling Mohamed Abouelenien’s areas of interest broadly cover data science topics, including applied machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

Dr. Joelle Abramowitz’s research examines the effects of different policies on individuals’ major life decisions and wellbeing including on health insurance and medical out-of-pocket expenditures as well as bigger picture effects on outcomes such as marriage, fertility, and work. She has worked intimately with a variety of datasets containing health insurance, demographic, employer, and administrative information, developing an expertise in the benefits, shortcomings, and intricacies of using and linking alternate datasets as well as a familiarity with the relevant literature, analytical approaches, and policy history in this line of research. In ongoing work, she applies this experience to enhancing Health and Retirement Study data through linkage with Census Bureau data on employers as part of the CenHRS project. This work includes considering how employer-sponsored health insurance offerings are changing in response to an aging workforce as well as changes in the employment arrangements of individuals nearing retirement. To this end, she considers how such changes affect a range of health- and economic-related outcomes, including physical and emotional wellbeing as well as economic security in retirement. I am an architect, educator, and creative practitioner/scholar/researcher. My work is focused on the intersections of materiality, technology, design, and construction, with an emphasis on adaptive reuse, equitable housing, and the socio-political and cultural aspects of digital architectural production and images. I write about digital materiality, software, and authorship. I am a principal of a collaborative architecture practice, called T+E+A+M, and a member of two interdisciplinary research collectives focused on equitable housing and ethical AI. Since 2023, I have served as the Director of U-M’s Digital Studies Institute, an interdisciplinary research and teaching unit focused on technology, digital culture, and social justice, primarily through the lenses of race, gender, disability, sexuality, class, power and identity. My work is at the intersection of data mining and human-computer interaction.  My research is focused on both modeling and the construction of new systems that leverage those models.  Current projects include mining large-scale social media systems (Twitter, Reddit), networks (e.g., academic citation graphs), text/networks (meme propagation, information extraction, news articles, political networks), and cross-cutting methods (link prediction, community detection).  Work on systems building includes new visualization systems (automated visualization, interactive machine learning, etc.), ranking systems (social feeds), and data-driven end-user support (end-user and developers). I am a pulmonary and critical care physician who is passionate about improving critical care delivery by applying advanced methods for causal inference to observational data. My prior work has leveraged real-world data clinical and administrative data to study the epidemiology of critical illness, the organization of critical care, and health care financing. My current work leverages real-world clinical data to understand whether and how care team fragmentation (transitions of physicians and other providers while a patient is still hospitalized) influences clinical outcomes like survival and recovery. Answering these questions correctly requires methods that are attentive to the complex causal structure underlying the relationship, depicted here. It features time-varying exposures (A), confounders (L), and mediators (M), all of which can influence clinical outcomes (Y). Arrows in the figure identify directional (i.e., causal) relationships between variables. My research focus is on the development and application of machine learning tools to large scale financial and unstructured (textual) data to extract, quantify and predict risk profiles and investment grade rating of private and public companies.  Example datasets include social media and financial aggregators such as Bloomberg, Pitchbook, and Privco. 9.9.2020 MIDAS Faculty Research Pitch Video. Dr. Aebersold’s professional and academic career is focused on advancing the science of learning applied in simulation to align clinician and student practice behaviors with research evidence to improve learner and health outcomes.  She focuses her scholarship in both high fidelity and virtual reality simulation and is a national leader and expert in simulation. Her scholarship has culminated in developing the Simulation Model to Improve Learner and Health Outcomes (SMILHO). Current Research Grants and Programs: Closing the loop: new data tools for measuring change in the quality for nursing education and the value of new approaches to instruction (PI) University of Michigan School of Nursing. Interactive anatomy-augmented virtual simulation training (PI with Voepel-Lewis) Archie MD Award Number 045889 Profile: Building a Better Nurse By Dan Meisler Communications Manager, ARC Michelle Aebersold has spent her career trying to “build a better nurse,” through training development, virtual clinical environments, and patient simulations. As Director of Simulation and Educational Innovation at the U-M School of Nursing, Aebersold is focused on creating realistic learning environments for nursing students. But it wasn’t until relatively recently that she realized she had an under-utilized but powerful tool at her disposal — data. For years, Aebersold has been collecting data on how student performance is affected by participation in various simulations, but it wasn’t until speaking to faculty from the Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS) that she realized the potential insights all of her historical datasets might have hidden inside. “We’re trying to pull them all together to create a common thread, so that as we collect data on our students, we can follow them to say how they progressed. How many simulations and what type of simulations did they get and how did that impact their learning?” Aebersold said. “We hit students with a lot of simulations while they’re in school, but we don’t necessarily know which ones are better for certain things.” Now, as MIDAS core faculty member, Aebersold will be able to easily collaborate with other MIDAS researchers to refine and analyze her data. Eventually, she said, she’d like to be able to track nursing students as they enter their first jobs to see how their training translates to real-world performance. And a further goal for Aebersold is to help the practice of nursing education become similar to the training world-class athletes receive, in which, for example, subjects review videos of their performance to identify what works and what doesn’t. “We’re going to introduce some things, like what can we do with virtual simulations, or what can we do with eye-tracking,” she said. “We really want to try to dive deeper, by being able to put all this information together using a lot of these data science methods.” Aebersold has been at U-M since the mid-1980s, serving in a variety of clinical and administrative roles. She earned a Ph.D in Nursing from the University in 2008, and served as Director of the Clinical Learning Center in the School of Nursing for eight years thereafter. Since 2016, she’s been Director of Simulation and Educational Innovation. One of Aebersold’s recent projects, “Closing the Loop: New Data Tools for measuring Changes in the Quality of Nursing Education,” applies modern data-science tools to help understand the correlation between traditional tests and student skills and competence when they enter the workforce, and whether simulations coupled with debriefing sessions translate into improvements in skills and in test outcomes. Another potential project will focus on comparing the eye movements of novice nurses to expert nurses. Aebersold said initial findings have shown that nurses with more experience tend to focus their eyes on one thing for longer periods of time than those with less. She said she’s enlisting help on that work from professors in the School of Information at U-M. “By really understanding the difference between how experts do things and novices do things, you can help develop simulations that help novices get better,” Aebersold said. She credits her father with starting her on the path to becoming a nurse; he was a police officer, and would sometimes take her to the local emergency room. “I loved the fast pace,” she recalled, and the chance to have a real, positive impact on people’s lives. After earning a nursing degree from Madonna University, she became a critical care nurse. She then gravitated toward supervision and administration, gaining a masters in business administration, also from Madonna University. She earned her Ph.D. from U-M while working as a nurse manager at the U-M health System. She said all the technology, data, and innovative modes of study she’s brought together are all in service of one goal. “For me, it all comes down to how can we make the patient care environment safer for our patients,” she said. Prof. Agarwal’s is primarily interested in number theory, in particular in p-adic L-functions, Bloch-Kato conjecture and automorphic forms. His secondary research interests are polynomials, geometry and math education, Machine Learning, and healthcare analytics. My research interests lie in design and analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), partial identification, identification and inference with multi-valued treatments and instruments, and quantile regression. In one recent paper I study the optimal stratified randomization procedure in RCTs, and found a certain kind of matched-pair design is optimal. In another paper (coauthored with Joe Romano and Azeem Shaikh), we provide asymptotically exact inference procedure for matched-pair designs. In another paper we study inference with moment inequalities whose dimension grows exponentially fast with the sample size. I also have a paper in which we study the sharp identified sets for various treatment effects with multi-valued instruments and multi-values treatments. Dr. Veera Baladandayuthapani is currently a Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Michigan (UM), where he is also the Associate Director of the Center for Cancer Biostatistics. He joined UM in Fall 2018 after spending 13 years in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, where was a Professor and Institute Faculty Scholar and held adjunct appointments at Rice University, Texas A&M University and UT School of Public Health.

An example of horizontal (across cancers) and vertical (across multiple molecular platforms) data integration. Image from Ha et al (Nature Scientific Reports, 2018; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32682-x) I am interested in the basic mechanisms of protein quality control systems at cellular membranes. I study how these systems select their substrates and aim to identify the cellular pathways regulated by them. These processes are important in pathologies related to cell stress, protein misfolding, and protein misregulation. Human illnesses linked to these problems include Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and various cancers. My longer-term goal is to understand how changing conditions in cells target substrate proteins to these integral-membrane quality control systems. Some of the questions that keep me up at night relate to the Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) system: How does ERAD recognize substrate proteins? What features of proteins make them substrates for selection? What role does the membrane play in the function of ERAD? What unknown proteins/pathways could be regulated by these systems? I am interested in setting up novel assays and using screening approaches to address these questions comprehensively. Insights from my approaches should allow screening for, and refinement of, therapeutics with value in a wide range of pathologies. Professor Balzano and her students investigate problems in statistical signal processing, machine learning, and optimization, particularly dealing with large and messy data. Her applications typically have missing, corrupted, and uncalibrated data as well as heterogeneous data in terms of sensors, sensor quality, and scale in both time and space. Her theoretical interests involve classes of non-convex matrix factorization problems, such as PCA and many interesting variants such as sparse or structured principal components, orthogonality and non-negativity constraints, nonlinear variants such as low-dimensional algebraic variety models, heteroscedastic data, and even categorical data or human preference data. She concentrates on fast gradient methods and related optimization methods that are scalable to real-time operation and massive data. Her work provides algorithmic and statistical guarantees for these algorithms on the aforementioned non-convex problems, and she focuses carefully on assumptions that are realistic for the relevant application areas in sensor networks, power systems, control, and computer vision. Moulinath Banerjee, PhD, is Professor of Statistics, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Moulinath Banerjee was born and raised in India where he completed both his Bachelors and Masters in Statistics at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He obtained his Ph.D. from the Statistics department at University of Washington, Seattle, in December 2000, served as lecturer there for Winter and Spring quarters, 2001, and joined University of Michigan in Fall 2001. Mouli’s research interests are in the fields of non-standard asymptotics, empirical process theory, threshold and boundary estimation, and graphical networks. His main contributions to date are in the areas of inference under shape-restrictions, especially monotone functions, and inference in the setting of designed multistage procedures. Mouli is the recipient of the 2011 IISA Young Investigators Award and an elected fellow of ISI. He has a broad range of interests outside of statistics which include classical music, literature, history, philosophy, physics and ancestral genetics. He is, also, most emphatically, a gourmet and believes that a life without good food is a life less lived. My research is primarily focused around 1) machine learning methods for understanding healthcare delivery and outcomes in the population, 2) analyses of correlated data (e.g. longitudinal and clustered data), and 3) survival analysis and competing risks analyses. We have developed tree-based and ensemble regression methods for censored and multilevel data, combination classifiers using different types of learning methods, and methodology to identify representative trees from an ensemble. These methods have been applied to important areas of biomedicine, specifically in patient prognostication, in developing clinical decision-making tools, and in identifying complex interactions between patient, provider, and health systems for understanding variations in healthcare utilization and delivery. My substantive areas of research are cancer and pediatric cardiovascular disease.

Accomplishments and Awards 2021 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award : Detecting Early-Warning Signals of Market Share Loss from Locus of Customer Movements My research focuses on methods, applications, and ethics of Computational Modeling in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Understanding and modeling human behavior supports innovative information technology that will change how we study and design interactive user experiences. I envision modeling the human accurately across domains as a theoretical foundation for work in HCI in which computational models provide a foundation to study, describe, and understand complex human behaviors and support optimization and evaluation of user interfaces. I create technology that automatically reasons about and acts in response to people’s behavior to help them be productive, healthy, and safe. Accomplishments and Awards AI guardrails can fall short in health care: study 2023 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: Detecting and Countering Untrustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) through AI Literacy In the area of multi-scale modeling of manufacturing processes: (a) Models for understanding the mechanisms of forming and joining of lightweight materials. This new understanding enables the development of advanced processes which remove limitations of current state-of-the-art capabilities that exhibit limited formability of high strength lightweight alloys, and limited reproducibility of joining quality; (b) Innovative multi-scale finite element models for ultrasonic welding of battery tabs (resulting in models adopted by GM for designing and manufacturing batteries for the Chevy Volt), and multi-scale models for ultrasonic welding of short carbon fiber composites (resulting in models adopted by GM for designing and manufacturing assemblies made of carbon fiber composites with metallic parts); (c) Data-driven algorithms of prediction geometrical and microstructural integrity of the incremental formed parts. Machine learning is used for developing fast and robust methods to be integrated into the designing process and replace finite element simulations. My research interests are to improve safety associated with motor-vehicle transportation by addressing both active safety (increased crash avoidance) and passive safety (increased crash protection) issues through the development and application of a wide range of research methodologies. These methodologies are targeted at developing a better understanding and modeling of driver behavior, including physical and cognitive attributes, driver decision-making processes and human intention prediction. I am currently interested in applying data science to study the following topics: *Driver state detection and prediction; *Improve user intersection with automated vehicle technologies; *Communication and interaction between vehicle and vulnerable road users *Driving style classification *Human factors issues associated with connected and automated vehicle technologies Where do drivers look when they are not paying attention to the road Dr. Barnes is a cardiologist and health services researcher who is passionate about improving care for patients with thrombotic conditions using innovative tools within the electronic health record. He uses user-centered design principles to develop clinical decision support and population health tools that support clinicians in making evidence-based decisions. Dr. Barnes partners closely with data scientists to leverage machine learning methods to enhance the implementation and usability of various tools with the electronic health record. For one project, his team developed a population management tool within the electronic health record to identify all patients using oral anticoagulant medication and to flag those whose prescription did not follow the FDA package label instructions. This tool, called the DOAC Dashboard, has now been implemented in five health systems nationally and has dramatically reduced off-label prescribing rates. Concurrently, he evaluated a similar tool within the Veterans Health Administration system and showed that use of their DOAC Dashboard was associated with a reduction in both off-label prescribing and a reduction in stroke and other thrombotic complications. For another project, his team developed a series of medication alerts within the electronic health record that appear at the time a clinician prescribes an off-label oral anticoagulant. We developed a system for real-time randomization so that we could compare the two different alerts to see which was most effective at achieving a change in the prescription. He started his research journey as a medical student, exploring the basics of anticoagulant prescribing. In medical school, he helped to write a grant application to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan that would fund a multi-site quality collaborative focused on anticoagulation care. As a faculty member here at the University of Michigan, he partnered with Dr. Michael Lanham, an informaticist, to develop the DOAC Dashboard and implement it in five different health systems. he works closely with colleagues from the Medical School and School of Public Health to implement best practices in clinical care with a focus on innovative uses of the electronic health record to guide clinician behavior change. In medicine, there is an overwhelming volume of data. No single person can keep up with the rapidly growing literature or the volume of data that is collected for individual patients. AI has the potential to rapidly summarize the literature and bring actionable data to the fingertips of clinicians in a way that guides them to make appropriate and safe decisions for their patients. Realizing this potential is what excites him most about data science and AI research in healthcare. Early warning systems (EWS) that predict patient outcomes for therapeutic interventions are increasingly being used to make clinical decisions. Predicted events often include outcomes such as unplanned ICU transfer, cardiac arrest, or death. The goal of these models is to provide a timely alert to clinicians so they can intervene and prevent these outcomes from occurring. However, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of an EWS after it has been deployed. For example, if the model correctly predicts a deterioration event, the clinician may take actions to prevent the patient’s predicted deterioration. If the clinician’s actions are successful, the deterioration is averted and the label against which the model is tested will become negative. This is despite the fact that the model’s positive prediction was correct. Without the context of the clinician intervention, the model will be evaluated as if it was wrong. Overall, the better the model is at improving outcomes, the worse the performance is going to appear. This is known as confounding medical interventions (CMI). In this project, we evaluated two causal inference frameworks for estimating model performance metrics such as sensitivity and PPV in the presence of CMI. To our knowledge, no other methods exist for estimating the performance of a model in the context of confounding medical interventions. I started doing research at the Medical College of Wisconsin while getting my Master's in Bioinformatics focusing on identifying genomic loci associated with diabetic traits in rats. I was really excited to be a part of a great group of people figuring out an interesting and complex problem. I continued doing genomics research throughout my Ph.D. at Marquette University and post-doc at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The majority of my work as a post-doc focused on understanding genetic variation in the context of the 3D genome. The spatial organization of the genome is such an important component of gene regulation, but at the time was previously understudied. I was involved in a number of collaborations involving this, and it was awesome being able to work with such crucial datasets (and it was A LOT of data). Coming to Michigan Medicine and working more on clinical problems rather than genomics has been a bit of a shift, but I have been able to apply all the research skills I gained over the last 10 years and continue to be excited by new and interesting data science problems. I think the most exciting thing about data science and AI research is not only using models for prediction but also what features drive the prediction. I also appreciate the increased focus on addressing potential bias in AI and making models more equitable and fairer. I am a big fan of looking "underneath the hood" and I am excited that more people are going beyond simply looking at overall performance. The picture is often much more complex and there are many nuances and potential pitfalls. However, addressing them is part of the process and can lead to increased public trust and model accuracy and usage. I run 800-1,200 miles total every year, but not I'm not at all fast. I have two Shiba Inus named after food (Marzipan and Soba). Changxiao Cai’s research interests lie broadly in the intersection of statistics, optimization, and machine learning. He is interested in developing provably scalable methods for information extraction from high-dimensional data, with an aim to achieve the optimal interplay between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Jessica K. Camp, PhD, is Assistant Professor of social work in the Department of Health and Health Services at the University of Michigan, Dearborn. Her research focuses on using large nationally representative data from the United States and internationally (SIPP, ACS, GSOEP) to explore trends in poverty and inequality. Specifically, I examine ways that marginalized and hyper-marginalized groups experience economic disparity and labor market exclusion. My most recent completed study showed how welfare reform can have a powerful impact on the well-being of working women, especially women with vulnerabilities. My area of expertise as a data analyst is in complex samples, regression, and longitudinal models. I am hoping my future work will inform ways that “Big Data” can be used in social work research. My research focuses on developing and using methods in machine learning and natural language processing to learn about society from text, promoting better and more reproducible data science, and studying the societal impacts of these technologies. I collaborate with colleagues in statistics, linguistics, political science, and other areas of computational social science to investigate how people communicate, the effects of this communication, and to better understand the potential consequences and limitations of data science and artificial intelligence.

Carter’s research combines quantitative, theoretical, and field approaches to address challenging local to global wildlife conservation issues in the Anthropocene. His work includes projects on endangered species conservation in human-dominated areas of Nepal, post-war recovery of wildlife in Mozambique, human-wildlife coexistence in the American West, and the effects of artificial lights and human-made noise on wildlife habitat across the contiguous US. Research methods focus on: (1) spatializing both human and wildlife processes, (2) probabilistic methods to infer human-wildlife interactions (3) simulation models of coupled natural-human systems, and (4) forecasting and decision-support tools. Tim Cernak, PhD, is Assistant Professor of Medicinal Chemistry with secondary appointments in Chemistry and the Chemical Biology Program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The functional and biological properties of a small molecule are encoded within its structure so synthetic strategies that access diverse structures are paramount to the invention of novel functional molecules such as biological probes, materials or pharmaceuticals. The Cernak Lab studies the interface of chemical synthesis and computer science to understand the relationship of structure, properties and reactions. We aim to use algorithms, robotics and big data to invent new chemical reactions, synthetic routes to natural products, and small molecule probes to answer questions in basic biology. Researchers in the group learn high-throughput chemical and biochemical experimentation, basic coding, and modern synthetic techniques. By studying the relationship of chemical synthesis to functional properties, we pursue the opportunity to positively impact human health. We have developed and tested machine learning approaches to integrate quantitative markers for diagnosis and assessment of progression of TMJ OA, as well as extended the capabilities of 3D Slicer4 into web-based tools and disseminated open source image analysis tools. Our aims use data processing and in-depth analytics combined with learning using privileged information, integrated feature selection, and testing the performance of longitudinal risk predictors. Our long term goals are to improve diagnosis and risk prediction of TemporoMandibular Osteoarthritis in future multicenter studies. The Spectrum of Data Science for Diagnosis of Osteoarthritis of the Temporomandibular Joint My research interests are in the area of natural language processing, situated dialogue agents, and artificial intelligence. I’m particularly interested in language processing that is sensorimotor-grounded, pragmatically-rich, and cognitively-motivated. My current work explores the intersection of language, vision, and robotics to facilitate situated communication with embodied agents and applies different types of data (e.g., capturing human behaviors in communication, perception, and, action) to advance core intelligence of AI. My broad research interests are in multi-agent systems, computational economics and finance, and artificial intelligence. I apply techniques from algorithmic game theory, statistical machine learning, decision theory, etc. to a variety of problems at the intersection of the computational and social sciences. A major focus of my research has been the design and analysis of market-making algorithms for financial markets and, in particular, prediction markets — incentive-based mechanisms for aggregating data in the form of private beliefs about uncertain events (e.g. the outcome of an election) distributed among strategic agents. I use both analytical and simulation-based methods to investigate the impact of factors such as wealth, risk attitude, manipulative behavior, etc. on information aggregation in market ecosystems. Another line of work I am pursuing involves algorithms for allocating resources based on preference data collected from potential recipients, satisfying efficiency, fairness, and diversity criteria; my joint work on ethnicity quotas in Singapore public housing allocation deserves special mention in this vein. More recently, I have got involved in research on empirical game-theoretic analysis, a family of methods for building tractable models of complex, procedurally defined games from empirical/simulated payoff data and using them to reason about game outcomes. My research interests are in developing inter-disciplinary knowledge in System Informatics, as the basis for study of complex system problems with the fusion of theory, computation, and application components adopted from Systems and Informatics fields. In this framework, a complex system such as the supply chain is posited as a System-of-Systems; i.e., a collection of individual business entities organized as a composite system with their resources and capabilities pooled to obtain an interoperable and synergistic system, possessing common and shared goals and objectives. Informatics facilitates coordination and integration in the system by processing and sharing information among supply chain entities for improved decision-making. A common theme of my research is the basic foundation of universality of system and the realization that what makes it unique is its environment. This has enabled to categorize problems, designs, models, methodologies, and solution techniques at macro and micro levels and develop innovative solutions by coordinating these levels in an integrated environment. My goal is to study the efficacy of the body of knowledge available in Systems Theory, Information Science, Artificial Intelligence & Knowledge Management, Management Science, Industrial Engineering and Operations Research fields; applied uniquely to issues and problems of complex systems in the manufacturing and service sectors. Theoretical work investigated by me in this research thrust relates to: Developing Generalized System Taxonomies and Ontologies for complex systems management. Experimenting with Problem Taxonomies for design and modeling efficiencies in complex system networks. Developing methodologies, frameworks and reference models for complex systems management. Computation and application development focused on developing algorithms and software development for: Supply chain information system and knowledge library using Web-based technology as a dissemination tool. Integration with Enterprise Resource Planning modules in SAP software. Supply chain management problem-solving through application of problem specific simulation and optimization. My research has extended to application domains in healthcare, textiles, automotive, and defense sectors. Problems and issues addressed relate to health care management, operationalizing of sustainability, energy conservation, global logistics management, mega-disaster recovery, humanitarian needs management, and entrepreneurship management. Currently, my application focus is on expanding the breadth and depth of inquiry in the healthcare domain. Among the topics being investigated are: (1) the organization and structure of health care enterprises; and (2) operations and strategies that relate to management of critical success factors, such as costs, quality, innovation and technology adoption by health care providers. Two significant topics that I have chosen to study with regard to care for elderly patients suffering from chronic congestive heart failure and hypertension are: (1) the design of patient-centered health care delivery to improve quality of care; and (2) managing enhanced care costs due to readmission of these patients.

Holt Award for Teaching Excellence  from the College of Engineering of the University of Michigan. Chao is a fellow of both IISE and INFORMS. My current data science research interest lies in the broad area of supply chain and its management.   I am particularly interested in using longitudinal data set to identify early signals (or warning) and to draw causal inferences pertaining to supply chain security and product quality and safety.   I am also interested in developing experiments to capture the behavioral side of decision makings to be complementary to secondary data analysis.   Industry setting wise, I have based my research on the auto industry, and will expand my auto-industry centered research into a broader, transportation industry oriented context.   I am also interested in food and agricultural products, pharmaceutical, and medical devices industries where product quality and safety have significant implications to human life and society as a whole. My research is about building sample-efficient machine learning models. My long term goal is to develop collaborative systems that can actively seek advice from humans and make faster decisions, resulting in reliable and practical systems. I specifically focus on design of sequential decision-making models to make them learn faster. We leverage advice from humans in various forms (implicit and explicit) to encourage favorable decisions and avoid decisions having catastrophic consequences. We also focus on minimizing the cost of seeking advice by building suitable machine learning models from historical advice data and reusing them when required. Our research also develops ways to solve complex tasks in Reinforcement Learning by leveraging various kinds of knowledge transfer mechanisms, curriculum learning, teacher-student framework etc. Advances in these directions would make decision-making models sample-efficient and better suited for solving real-world problems. Along the supervised machine learning spectrum, we also focus on problems related to learning with less data, traditionally known as Active Learning, semi-supervised learning, and learning from multiple experts.

My research is broadly concerned with corporate governance and the effects of finance on society. Recent writings examine how ideas about corporate social responsibility have evolved to meet changes in the structures and geographic footprint of multinational corporations; whether “shareholder capitalism” is still a viable model for economic development; how income inequality in an economy is related to corporate size and structure; why theories about organizations do (or do not) progress; how architecture shapes social networks and innovation in organizations; why stock markets spread to some countries and not others; and whether there exist viable organizational alternatives to shareholder-owned corporations in the United States.

My research interests span topics in Statistical Machine Learning, Computational Social Science, Natural Language Processing, and Field/Digital Experiments. Substantively, I am interested in understanding the impact of internet technologies on users by empirically studying their interactions with such systems. The research questions that I study are of both predictive as well as causal nature and I examine them by using data from text/natural language and social network domains. The same network is displayed, parameterized by four different models of the distribution of influence and susceptibility over nodes, characterized by four types of nodes: low influence and low susceptibility nodes, high influence and low susceptibility nodes, high influence and high susceptibility nodes and low influence and high susceptibility nodes. The optimal seed nodes selected under each model are outlined in green. a, Baseline IC and LT models for which propagation properties are specified as constant (top) and the inverse of node degree (bottom), respectively. b, Baseline IC and LT models for which propagation properties are specified according to the assortative influence, assortative susceptibility, substitute influence–susceptibility (AAS) model. c–e, The same information as in b, but for the assortative influence, disassortative susceptibility, substitute influence–susceptibility (ADS; c), disassortative influence, disassortative susceptibility, substitute influence–susceptibility (DDS; d) and disassortative influence, assortative susceptibility, substitute influence–susceptibility (DAS; e) empirical influence models. Distributions of the frequency of the four types of nodes with different influence and susceptibility characterizations are displayed underneath each graph or model. Seed sets differ substantially across different parameterizations of the graph, implying vastly different influence maximization results for the different models of influence and susceptibility. **This figure is taken from the paper: “Social influence maximization under empirical influence models” by (Aral and Dhillon, Nature Human Behaviour 2018).** MIDAS Faculty Research Pitch, Fall 2021 Accomplishments and Awards 2021 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: Robust Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts and Shocks: Application to Sustainable Air Quality My lab is primarily interested in how the brain represents, coordinates, and stores memories. Hippocampal neuronal networks generate an assortment of firing patterns that vary depending on the behavior and state of an animal, from active exploration to resting and different stages of sleep. In our lab’s extracellular recordings from large populations of spiking neurons in rodents, we observe state-dependent temporal relationships between activities at multiple timescales. Recent work in my lab is aimed at understanding what role these unique spike patterns play and what they tell us about the function and limitations of different brain states for memory in healthy and compromised animals. To answer these and related questions, we combine behavioral studies of freely moving, learning and exploring rats, multi-channel recordings of the simultaneous electrical (spiking) activity from hundreds of neurons during behavior, sleep and sleep-deprivation, statistical and machine learning tools to uncover deep structure within high-dimensional spike trains, and chemogenetics and optogenetics to manipulate protein signaling and action potentials in specific neural populations in precise time windows.

Analyzing Big observational data including thousands of Parkinson’s disease patients based on tens-of-thousands signature biomarkers derived from multi-source imaging, genetics, clinical, physiologic, phenomics and demographic data elements is challenging. We are developing Big Data representation strategies, implementing efficient algorithms and introducing software tools for managing, analyzing, modeling and visualizing large, complex, incongruent and heterogeneous data. Such service-oriented platforms and methodological advances enable Big Data Discovery Science and present existing opportunities for learners, educators, researchers, practitioners and policy makers. My primary research interests are understanding the causes and consequences of biased selection and attention to persuasive information, particularly in the context of health promotion. Simply stated, I am interested in what we pay attention to and why, and how this attention (or inattention) influences attitudinal and behavioral outcomes, such as persuasion and healthy behavior. In particular, my work has addressed disparities in attention to information about HIV prevention for African-Americans compared to European-Americans as a predictor of disparities in health outcomes. I am also exploring barriers to attention to health information by African-Americans, including the roles of stigma, shame, fear, and perceptions of irrelevance. At a more basic attitudes and persuasion level, I am currently pursuing work relevant to how we select information for liked versus disliked others, and how the role of choice influences how we process information we agree versus disagree with.

Our lab’s research interests are in the areas of oncology bioinformatics, multimodality image analysis, and treatment outcome modeling. We operate at the interface of physics, biology, and engineering with the primary motivation to design and develop novel approaches to unravel cancer patients’ response to chemoradiotherapy treatment by integrating physical, biological, and imaging information into advanced mathematical models using combined top-bottom and bottom-top approaches that apply techniques of machine learning and complex systems analysis to first principles and evaluating their performance in clinical and preclinical data. These models could be then used to personalize cancer patients’ chemoradiotherapy treatment based on predicted benefit/risk and help understand the underlying biological response to disease. These research interests are divided into the following themes: Bioinformatics: design and develop large-scale datamining methods and software tools to identify robust biomarkers (-omics) of chemoradiotherapy treatment outcomes from clinical and preclinical data. Multimodality image-guided targeting and adaptive radiotherapy: design and develop hardware tools and software algorithms for multimodality image analysis and understanding, feature extraction for outcome prediction (radiomics), real-time treatment optimization and targeting.

In particular, I am interested in using educational data mining to close the feedback loop and improve the instructional materials. I am also interested in learner sourcing to automatically generate and improve assessments. I have been applying principles from educational psychology such as worked examples plus low cognitive load practice to improve instruction. I have been exploring mixed-up code (Parsons) problems as one type of practice. I created two types of adaptation for Parsons problems: intra-problem and inter-problem. In intra-problem adaptation, if the learner is struggling to solve the current problem it can dynamically be made easier. In inter-problem adaptation the difficulty of the next problem is based on the learner’s performance on the previous problem. I study cybercrime using data-driven methods to analyze, characterize, and measure the infrastructure and modus operandi used by criminal activities on the Internet. In particular, I focus on collection, analysis, and semantic characterization of cyber threat intelligence that comes in many shapes and forms (e.g., natural language, network traffic, system audit logs). The ultimate goal is to learn insights that will inform decisions on building robust defense against online criminal activities that involve threats such as ransomware, exploit kits, and botnets. To achieve these goals, I find graph theory and analytics, machine learning (deep learning), longitudinal analysis, and causality inference to be the natural methods. I also study the training and deployment of cyber threat classification/prediction systems in adversarial settings. From behavioral fingerprinting and detection of cybercrime toolkits to analytics and detection of online cyber threats; from semantic characterization of cyber threat intelligence to detection and forensics of advanced cyber attacks, machine learning, graph theory and analytics, graph isomorphism, and causal inference serve as the core ingredients to build robust defense against cyber threats.

Tayo Fabusuyi is an assistant research scientist in the Human Factors Group at UMTRI. His research interests are in Urban Systems and Operations Research, specifically designing and implementing initiatives that support sustainable and resilient communities with a focus on efficiency and equity issues. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data, his research develops and applies hard and soft Operations Research methods to urban systems issues in a manner that emphasizes theory driven solutions with demonstrated value-added. A central theme of his research activities is the use of demand side interventions, via information and pricing strategies in influencing the public’s travel behavior with the objective of achieving more beneficial societal outcomes. Informed by the proliferation of big data and the influence of transportation in the urban sphere, these research activities are categorized broadly into three overlapping and interdependent areas – intelligent transportation systems (ITS), emerging mobility services and urban futures . Before joining the research faculty at UMTRI, Dr. Fabusuyi was a Planning Economist at the African Development Bank and an adjunct Economics faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University, where he received his Ph.D. in Engineering and Public Policy. We conduct research to analyze breath from patients in order to diagnose and monitor diseases. We also develop imaging modalities to analyze tissues for cancer diagnosis My core research focuses on the politics and measurement of human rights, discrimination, violence, and repression. I use computational methods to understand why governments around the world torture, maim, and kill individuals within their jurisdiction and the processes monitors use to observe and document these abuses. Other projects cover a broad array of themes but share a focus on computationally intensive methods and research design. These methodological tools, essential for analyzing data at massive scale, open up new insights into the micro-foundations of state repression and the politics of measurement. People rely more on strong ties for job help in countries with greater inequality. Coefficients from 55 regressions of job transmission on tie strength are compared to measures of inequality (Gini coefficient), mean income per capita, and population, all measured in 2013. Gray lines indicate 95% confidence regions from 1000 simulated regressions that incorporate uncertainty in the country-level regressions (see below for more details). In each simulated regression we draw each country point from the distribution of regression coefficients implied by the estimate and standard error for that country and measure of tie strength. P values indicate the simulated probability that there is no relationship between tie strength and the other variable. Laura K. Gee, Jason J. Jones, Christopher J. Fariss, Moira Burke, and James H.

Accomplishments and Awards 2022 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: Improving Cardiovascular Disease Detection with a Novel Multi-label Classifier for Electrocardiograms: Capturing Label Uncertainty and Complex Hierarchical Relationships between Output Classes Today’s real-world problems are complex and large, often with overwhelmingly large number of unknown variables which render them doomed to the so-called “curse of dimensionality”. For instance, in energy systems, the system operators should solve optimal power flow, unit commitment, and transmission switching problems with tens of thousands of continuous and discrete variables in real time. In control systems, a long standing question is how to efficiently design structured and distributed controllers for large-scale and unknown dynamical systems. Finally, in machine learning, it is important to obtain simple, interpretable, and parsimonious models for high-dimensional and noisy datasets. Our research is motivated by two main goals: (1) to model these problems as tractable optimization problems; and (2) to develop structure-aware and scalable computational methods for these optimization problems that come equipped with certifiable optimality guarantees. We aim to show that exploiting hidden structures in these problems—such as graph-induced or spectral sparsity—is a key game-changer in the pursuit of massively scalable and guaranteed computational methods. 9.9.2020 MIDAS Faculty Research Pitch Video. My research lies at the intersection of optimization, data analytics, and control. Accomplishments and Awards 2021 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: IPODS: Innovative and Powerful Optimization Methods for Data Science with Statistical Guarantees My research examines how people make choices in uncertain environments. The general focus is on using statistical models to explain complex decision patterns, particularly involving sequential choices among related items (e.g., brands in the same category) and dyads (e.g., people choosing one another in online dating), as well as a variety of applications to problems in the marketing domain (e.g., models relating advertising exposures to awareness and sales). The main methods used lie primarily in discrete choice models, ordinarily estimated using Bayesian methods, dynamic programming, and nonparametrics. I’m particularly interested in extending Bayesian analysis to very large databases, especially in terms of ‘fusing’ data sets with only partly overlapping covariates to enable strong statistical identification of models across them. Applying Bayesian Methods to Problems in Dynamic Choice Dr. Feng’s research involves conducting and using naturalistic observational studies to better understand the interactions between motorists and other road users including bicyclists and pedestrians. The goal is to use an evidence-based, data-driven approach that improves bicycling and walking safety and ultimately makes them viable mobility options. A naturalistic study is a valuable and unique research method that provides continuous, high-time-resolution, rich, and objective data about how people drive/ride/walk for their everyday trips in the real world. It also faces challenges from the sheer volume of the data, and as with all observational studies, there are potential confounding factors compared to a randomized laboratory experiment. Data analytic methods can be developed to interpret the behavioral data, make meaningful inferences, and get actionable insights. 9.9.2020 MIDAS Faculty Research Pitch Video.

His current research focuses on: the energy costs of forming and maintaining social ties; computational mediation of trust in virtual organizations; and use of ultra-resolution collaboration environments. My research tackles how human values can be incorporated into machine learning and other computational systems. This includes work on the translation process from human values to computational definitions and work on how to understand and encourage fairness while preventing discrimination in machine learning and data science. My research combines tools from the theory of machine learning with insights from economics, science and technology studies, and philosophy, among others, to improve our theories of the translation process and the algorithms we create. In settings like classification, social networks, and data markets, I explore the ways in which human values play a primary role in the quality of machine learning and data science. The likelihood of receiving desirable information like public health information or job advertisements depends on both your position in a social network, and on who directly gets the information to start with (the seeds). This image shows how a new method for deciding who to select as the seeds, called maximin, outperforms the most popular approach in previous literature by decreasing the correlation between where you are in the social network and your likelihood of receiving the information.

As faculty member within the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, Dr. Flannagan currently serves as Director of the Center for Management of Information for Safe and Sustainable Transportation (CMISST) and Head of the Statistics and Methods Group for the CDC-funded UM Injury Center. Dr. Flannagan has over 20 years of experience conducting data analysis and research on injury risk related to motor vehicle crashes and was responsible for the development of a model of injury outcome that allows side-by-side comparison of public health, vehicle, roadway and post-crash interventions (utmost.umtri.umich.edu). She has also applied statistical methods to understanding and evaluating benefits of crash-avoidance technologies, including evaluating safety in automated vehicles, and works to develop novel applications of statistics to analysis of driving data. Her current work with CMISST involves the fusion and analysis of large state-level crash databases, which are useful in analyzing the effect of a variety of countermeasures on crash involvement and injury risk. In addition, her group is working to make data available to researchers to expand the community of experts in transportation data analysis. Q & A with Dr. Carol Flannagan Q:  When in your career did you realize that data (broadly speaking) could open a lot of doors, in terms of research? I have loved data analysis since my undergraduate Experimental Design course sophomore year when I learned about analysis of 2X2 tables. Beyond that, I didn’t necessarily see it as a career move or a research program. It was much later at UMTRI, when I started thinking about how much data we had scattered around the building and how great it would be to round up those data and share them, that I though explicitly about data per se as opening research doors. In 2010, I was asked to head up the Transportation Data Center at UMTRI. In spite of its name, the group was doing very limited things with crash data at the time. After a few years, the group got a new name and some support to grow from UMOR. That, along with a number of research projects over the years, has led to our current incarnation with substantially upgraded data hosting for the state of Michigan’s crash data and strong capabilities in data analysis of all kinds of newer transportation data. For example, we have collaborated with the Engineering Systems group, GM and OnStar to conduct a series of studies funded by NHTSA to analyze driver response to crash avoidance systems using OnStar data on a large scale. With the MIDAS transportation project, we are moving forward on several fronts. Most importantly, we are developing a high-performance data access and processing system to handle the large driving datasets that UMTRI has collected (and continues to collect). This system can integrate automated video processing with analysis and/or querying of time series data (e.g., speed, acceleration, etc.). For my group, this new capability opens new doors in both data sharing and data analysis. Q: How has the field, and specifically the use of “Big Data,” changed during your career? Wow… My first analyses as an undergrad were computed by hand as a matter of course. In grad school, since we needed to access terminals to use MTS (the Michigan Terminal System), it was often faster to just do it by hand (using a calculator and paper and pencil). What that meant is that computation was a true limitation on how much data could be analyzed. Even after personal computers were a regular fixture in research (and at home), computation of any size (e.g., more subjects or more variables) was still slow. My dissertation included a simulation component and I used to set simulations running every night before I went to bed. The simulation would finish around 2-3 a.m., and the computer would suddenly turn on, sending bright light into the room and waking my husband and me up. Those simulations can all be done in minutes or seconds now. Imagine how much more I could have done with current systems! In the last 5 years, I’ve gotten much more involved in analysis of driving data to understand benefits of crash avoidance systems. We are often searching these data for extracts that contain certain kinds of situations that are relevant to such systems (e.g., hard braking events related to forward collision warnings). This is one use of Big Data—to observe enough that you can be sure of finding examples of what you’re interested in. However, in the last year or two, I have been more involved in full-dataset analyses, large-scale triggered data collection, and large-scale kinematic simulations. These are all enabled by faster computing and because of that, we can find richer answers to more questions. Q: What role does your association with MIDAS play in this continuing development? One of the advantages of being associated with MIDAS is that it gives me access to faculty who are interested in data as opposed to transportation. It’s not that I need other topic areas, but I often find that when I listen to data and methods talks in totally different content areas, I can see how those methods could apply to problems I care about. For example, the challenge grant in the social sciences entitled “Computational Approaches for the Construction of Novel Macroeconomic Data,” is tackling a problem for economists that transportation researchers share. That is, how do you help researchers who may not have deep technical skill in data querying get at extracts from very large, complex datasets easily? Advances that they make in that project could be transferred to transportation datasets, which share many of the characteristics of social-media datasets. Another advantage is the access to students who are in data-oriented programs (e.g., statistics, data science, computer science, information, etc.) who want real-world experiences using their skills. I have had a number of data science students reach out to me and worked closely with two of them on independent studies where we worked together on Big Data analysis problems in transportation. One was related to measuring and tracking vehicle safety in automated vehicles and the other was in text mining of a complaints dataset to try to find failure patterns that might indicate the presence of a vehicle defect. Q: What are the next research challenges for transportation generally and your work specifically? Transportation is in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime transformation. In my lifetime, I expect to be driven to the senior center and my gerontologist appointments by what amounts to a robot (on wheels). Right now, I’m working on research problems that will help bring that to fruition. Data science is absolutely at the core of that transformation and the problems are wide open. I’m particularly concerned that our research datasets need to be managed in a way that opens them to a broad audience where we support both less technical interactions (e.g., data extracts with a very simple querying system) and much more technical interactions (e.g., full-dataset automatic video processing to identify drivers using cell phones in face video). I’m also interested in new and efficient large-scale data collection methods, particularly those based on the idea of “smart” or triggered sampling rather than just acquisition of huge datasets “because the information I want is somewhere in there…if only I can find it…” My own work has mostly been about safety, and although we envision a future without traffic fatalities (or ideally without crashes), the current fatality count has gone up over the past couple of years. Thus, I spend time analyzing crash data for new insights into changes in safety over time and even how the economy influences fatality counts. Much of my work is for the State of Michigan around predicting how many fatalities there will be in the next few years and identifying the benefits and potential benefits of various interventions. My web tool, UTMOST, (the Unified Theory Mapping Opportunities for Safety Technologies ) allows visualization of the benefits, or potential benefits, of many different kinds of interventions, including public health policy, vehicle technology, and infrastructure improvements. I think this kind of integrated approach will be necessary to achieve the goal of zero fatalities over the next 20 years. Finally, a significant part of my research program will continue to be development and use of statistical methods to measure, predict, and understand safety in transportation. How can we tell if AVs are safer than humans? What should future traffic safety data systems look like? How can we integrate data systems (e.g., crash and injury outcome) to better understand safety and figure out how to prioritize countermeasure development? How can machine learning and other big data statistical tools help us make the most of driving data? Johann Gagnon-Bartsch, PhD, is Assistant Professor of Statistics in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Prof. Gagnon-Bartsch’s research currently focuses on the analysis of high-throughput biological data as well as other types of high-dimensional data. More specifically, he is working with collaborators on developing methods that can be used when the data are corrupted by systematic measurement errors of unknown origin, or when the data suffer from the effects of unobserved confounders. For example, gene expression data suffer from both systematic measurement errors of unknown origin (due to uncontrolled variations in laboratory conditions) and the effects of unobserved confounders (such as whether a patient had just eaten before a tissue sample was taken). They are developing methodology that is able to correct for these systematic errors using “negative controls.” Negative controls are variables that (1) are known to have no true association with the biological signal of interest, and (2) are corrupted by the systematic errors, just like the variables that are of interest. The negative controls allow us to learn about the structure of the errors, so that we may then remove the errors from the other variables. Microarray data from tissue samples taken from three different regions of the brain (anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum) of ten individuals. The 30 tissue samples were separately analyzed in three different laboratories (UC Davis, UC Irvine, U of Michigan). The left plot shows the first two principal components of the data. The data cluster by laboratory, indicating that most of the variation in the data is systematic error that arises due to uncontrolled variation in laboratory conditions. The second plot shows the data after adjustment. The data now cluster by brain region (cortex vs. cerebellum). The data is from GEO (GSE2164).

I apply my biomedical informatics and analytical expertise to study diseases such as cancers, as well the impact of pregnancy/early life complications on later life diseases. Accomplishments and Awards 11 reasons why we’ve stayed in academia The Computational Materials Physics group under the direction of Vikram Gavini focuses on developing computational frameworks and algorithms to enable large-scale ab-initio calculations for predictive materials simulations. The two main present thrusts of the group since 2020 are: (i) Developing fast and accurate large-scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations; (ii) Development of a computational framework for improving the accuracy of DFT calculations by improving the exchange-correlation description with an aim to advance the accuracy towards quantum accuracy. DFT-FE a massively parallel and GPU ported real-space DFT code based on finite-element discretization originated from this group. The group is focused on data-driven approaches to improve the exchange-correlation description in DFT as well as accelerate predictive atomistic calculations. Dr. Gaynanova’s research focuses on the development of statistical methods for analysis of modern high-dimensional biomedical data. Her methodological interests are in data integration, machine learning and high-dimensional statistics, motivated by challenges arising in analyses of multi-omics data (e.g., RNASeq, metabolomics, micribiome) and data from wearable devices (continuous glucose monitors, ambulatory blood pressure monitors, activity trackers).Dr. Gaynanova’s research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, and recognized with a David P. Byar Young Investigator Award and an NSF CAREER Award. She currently serves as an Associate Editor for Journal of the American Statistical Association, Biometrika and Data Science in Science. Analysis of a large corpus of student writing in response to concept-focused prompts.

Brenda Gillespie, PhD, is Associate Director in Consulting for Statistics, Computing and Analytics Research (CSCAR) with a secondary appointment as Associate Research Professor in the department of Biostatistics in the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. She provides statistical collaboration and support for numerous research projects at the University of Michigan. She teaches Biostatistics courses as well as CSCAR short courses in survival analysis, regression analysis, sample size calculation, generalized linear models, meta-analysis, and statistical ethics. Her major areas of expertise are clinical trials and survival analysis. Prof. Gillespie’s research interests are in the area of censored data and clinical trials. One research interest concerns the application of categorical regression models to the case of censored survival data. This technique is useful in modeling the hazard function (instead of treating it as a nuisance parameter, as in Cox proportional hazards regression), or in the situation where time-related interactions (i.e., non-proportional hazards) are present. An investigation comparing various categorical modeling strategies is currently in progress. Another area of interest is the analysis of cross-over trials with censored data. Brenda has developed (with M. Feingold) a set of nonparametric methods for testing and estimation in this setting. Our methods out-perform previous methods in most cases. Pamela Giustinelli, is an Adjunct Research Assistant Professor in the Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Pamela is interested in modeling, empirical, and counterfactual policy analysis of individual and multilateral decision making under uncertainty-ambiguity, especially as it applies to the family and human capital contexts. She is also interested in survey methodology, particularly as it relates to this line of research. Here are some important questions in her research agenda: How do preferences, beliefs, choice sets, and other elements of a choice situation determine what choices people make and also how they make those choices? (That is, the “decision rules,” “decision protocols,” or “modes of interactions” they use.) And how are those elements formed? What information do individuals and groups have or use when making decisions under uncertainty? And what information is or is not shared among decision makers in multilateral settings? What are the implications of the above points for policy? To inform modeling, identification, and prediction of choice behaviors, what components of individuals’ and groups’ decision processes can we sensibly measure in surveys? From whom? And in what formats?

Prof. Glotzer and her group are focused on the new revolution in nano-science, engineering and technology is being driven by our ability to manipulate matter at the molecular, nanoparticle, and colloidal level to create “designer” structures. The Glotzer group uses computer simulation to discover the fundamental principles of how nanoscale systems of building blocks self-assemble, and to discover how to control the assembly process to engineer new materials. By mimicking biological assembly, we are exploring ways to nano-engineer materials that are self-assembling, self-sensing, and self-regulating. The group is developing theory and molecular simulation tools to understand these materials, and elucidate the nature of supercooled liquids, glasses, and crystallization. The Glotzer group develops in-house, open-source software for simulation, data analysis, and more. We invite the scientific community to learn more and utilize our software .

My research centers on designing future energy systems under deep decarbonization, and achieving clean, reliable, and affordable energy for All. My research advances methodologies for planning and operating electric power infrastructure using optimization and AI, and leveraging principles of energy economics and energy justice. My research engages with key stakeholders including system operators, utilities, and communities, to ensure our algorithms are deployable in real systems and that our frameworks meet the needs of communities and society. I am committed to improving access of STEM education and opportunities for women and underrepresented communities, and committed to mentoring diverse leaders in engineering and STEM. I collaborate with organizations on workshops, hackathons, and various activities for AI education and research. The most significant scientific contribution I would like to make is in developing holistic ways of decision-making for decarbonized energy systems that advance our goal of: clean, reliable, and affordable energy for All. Our research doesn’t stop in the lab: tech transfer from lab to industry, science-backed policy and regulatory changes, and education through student engagement and public outreach programs are vital to our success. I’m excited at the potential to leverage data science and AI to support the energy transition, in communities and globally around the world. I want to change the way we, as individuals and society, think about energy, and bring this to the front of our day-to-day lives.

Accomplishments and Awards Computer expert hacks Dominion Voting Machine in front of judge, changes votes with Bic pen My research focuses on the development of novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology for imaging the heart. We focus in particular on quantitative imaging techniques, in which the signal intensity at each pixel in an image represents a measurement of an inherent property of a tissue. Much of our research is based on cardiac Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF), which is a class of methods for simultaneously measuring multiple tissue properties from one rapid acquisition. Our group is exploring novel ways to combine physics-based modeling of MRI scans with deep learning algorithms for several purposes. First, we are exploring the use of deep learning to design quantitative MRI scans with improved accuracy and precision. Second, we are developing deep learning approaches for image reconstruction that will allow us to reduce image noise, improve spatial resolution and volumetric coverage, and enable highly accelerated acquisitions to shorten scan times. Third, we are exploring ways of using artificial intelligence to derive physiological motion signals directly from MRI data to enable continuous scanning that is robust to cardiac and breathing motion. In general, we focus on algorithms that are either self-supervised or use training data generated in computer simulations, since the collection of large amounts of training data from human subjects is often impractical when designing novel imaging methods.

Marcelline Harris, Ph.D., R.N., is Associate Professor of Systems, Populations and Leadership in the School of Nursing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Dr. Harris’s research interests focus on what is being labeled the “continuous use” of clinical data (the use of clinical data for one or more purposes), computable knowledge representation strategies, and the use of electronic clinical data for practice and research.  Her research has been funded by NIH, AHRQ, RWJF, and PCORI.  Harris also has extensive enterprise level experience, having served in both scientific and operational positions that address the development and governance of systems that support the capture, storage, indexing, and retrieval of clinical data.  At Michigan, she retains this translational perspective, emphasizing clinical data for patient-centered research, clinical surveillance and predictive analytics. Catherine H. Hausman is an Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. She uses causal inference, related statistical methods, and microeconomic modeling to answer questions at the intersection of energy markets, environmental quality, climate change, and public policy. Recent projects have looked at inequality and environmental quality, the natural gas sector’s role in methane leaks, the impact of climate change on the electricity grid, and the effects of nuclear power plant closures. Her research has appeared in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Accomplishments and Awards In the central U.S., an electric grid bottleneck persists Research interests include quantile regression modeling for associations related to possibly unusual or extreme events, subgroup analysis, and uncertainty quantification after model selection. My laboratory data science research includes: (1) Ontology development. We have initiated and led the development of several community-based ontologies, including Vaccine Ontology (VO), Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE), Cell Line Ontology (CLO), Ontology of Genes and Genomes (OGG), and Interaction Network Ontology (INO). (2) Ontology tool development. We have developed many ontology software programs, such as OntoFox and Ontobee, which are widely used for ontology reuse, ontology development, and ontology applications. (3) Literature mining, with a focus on ontology-based literature mining approaches. (4) Bayesian network (BN) modeling for analysis of gene interaction networks. Meanwhile, we have applied these ontologies, ontology-related approaches, and BN modeling in different data science domains including vaccinology, microbiology, immunology, and pharmacovigilance. With ever increasing quantities of big data, how to integrate, share, and analyze these data has become a huge challenge. Hundreds of biological interaction pathway resources are publicly available. While each of these resources is widely used, the data in these resources are typically overlapped but not integrated. This disintegration results in redundant work and inefficient data usages. An ontology is a human- and computer-interpretable set of terms and relations that represent entities in a specific domain and how these terms relate to each other. As part of a funded MCubed Diamond project, we aim to ontologically and non-redundantly represent and integrate various molecular interactions, pathways, and networks. The integrated ontology of interaction pathways and networks will then be used by novel statistical and computational methods to efficiently address various scientific problems. Margaret Hedstrom, PhD, is the Robert M Warner Collegiate Professor of Information in the School of Information and Faculty Associate in the Institute for Social Research.

My applied research focuses on simulation models of the progression of multiple chronic complications and comorbidities of diabetes and its precursors. I study the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early interventions in the progression of diabetes. My methodological research synthesizes secondary data from complementary studies to model complex processes. Machine learning approaches and new data science algorithms are an emerging frontier for the atmospheric sciences. We explore whether newly developed physics-guided machine learning algorithms trained with atmospheric model data or observations can serve as emulators for physical processes in weather and climate models, such as the time-consuming solar radiation code, precipitation mechanisms, or the shallow or deep convection cloud schemes. A second, less aggressive approach is to utilize machine learning approaches for the estimation of uncertain parameters in the subgrid-scale physical parameterizations of atmospheric models. We use idealized weather and climate model configurations to intercompare the pros and cons of various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, random forests, boosted forests, artificial neural networks and deep neural networks with and without convolutions. In addition, we are interested in machine learning approaches to understand and foster the predictability of the climate system over subseasonal-to seasonal (weeks-to-months) time scales.

Interesting projects: I direct the NSF Institute Framework for Integrative Data Equity Systems ( FIDES ). Equity matters as we increasingly use data and AI methods in so many aspects of our lives. These powerful tools can magnify existing inequities or inadvertently introduce inequities because of system design choices. Our work in this topic is to develop methods that can systematically identify inequities in the data and potentially also address them.

Why I’m passionate about my work: Data science has so much potential to do good things in so many aspects of life and society. I’m passionate about helping with that transformation and helping Michigan lead in that transformation while at the same time being cognizant of the potential risk and pitfalls. I want to help us get as much of the benefit of data science and AI as we can without suffering the harm they could bring if mismanaged.

He has interests in and has publised in various areas of statistics and biostatistics including life history and survival analysis, likelihood methods of inference, bootstrapping and estimating equations, mixture and mixed effects models and medical applications, particularly in the area of renal disease and organ transplantation. Dr. Kalbfleisch is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. He is also an elected member of the International Statistical Institute, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a Gold Medalist of the Statistical Society of Canada. He also received the Distinguished Research Award from the UM School of Public Health in 2011. A primary research interest is in the development of models and methods for analyzing failure time or event history data. Applications of this work arise in many areas including epidemiology, medicine, demography and engineering. In event history data, interest centers on the timing and occurrence of various kinds of events such as, for example, repeated infections or recurrences of disease, or other sequences of events that may occur during a study period. I have been particularly interested in situations in which only partial data or data subject to sampling bias are available. In recent years, I have been working on statistical aspects of problems associated with End Stage Renal Disease and solid organ transplantation. The Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center has many projects associated with these including various projects funded through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This  provides a rich area of application where statistical methods and developments play a substantial role in defining public policy. I am particularly interested in the development of appropriate methods for the use of such data in profiling and/or ranking medical providers. I have recently worked on the optimization and simulation of kidney paired donation programs. In these, candidates in need of a kidney transplant who have a willing but incompatible living donor are entered into a pool and we seek exchanges of donors to overcome incompatibilities. Added to this is the potential for non-directed donors who can give a kidney to one member of the pool and hence create a chain of transplants. Our methods use integer programming methods to create flexible allocation schemes that have the potential to provide substantial increases in the number of transplants achieved. My group conducts research in automation and robotics to improve work processes in the construction, operation, and maintenance of civil infrastructure and the built environment. Our research has developed several licensable technologies that include visualization, perception, and modeling techniques to help on-site construction robots with autonomous decision making. We are particularly interested in exploring new methods for enabling collaborative work strategies for human-robot teams jointly performing field construction work. In addition, we are also interested in exploring methods to integrate data to support semi-autonomous mobility for people with physical disabilities in the urban built environment. Hyun Min Kang is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of California, San Diego in 2009 and joined the University of Michigan faculty in the same year. Prior to his doctoral studies, he worked as a research fellow at the Genome Research Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Disease in the Seoul National University Hospital for a year and a half, after completing his Bachelors and Masters degree in Electrical Engineering at Seoul National University. His research interest lies in big data genome science. Methodologically, his primary focus is on developing statistical methods and computational tools for large-scale genetic studies. Scientifically, his research aims to understand the etiology of complex disease traits, including type 2 diabetes, bipolar disorder, cardiovascular diseases, and glomerular diseases. Dr. Kang’s research focuses on the developments of statistical methods motivated by biomedical applications with a focus on neuroimaging. His recent key contributions can be summarized in the following three aspects: Bayesian regression for complex biomedical applications Dr. Kang and his group developed a series of Bayesian regression methods for the association analysis between the clinical outcome of interests (disease diagnostics, survival time, psychiatry scores) and the potential biomarkers in biomedical applications such as neuroimaging and genomics. In particular, they developed a new class of threshold priors as compelling alternatives to classic continuous shrinkages priors in Bayesian literatures and widely used penalization methods in frequentist literatures. Dr. Kang’s methods can substantially increase the power to detect weak but highly dependent signals by incorporating useful structural information of predictors such as spatial proximity within brain anatomical regions in neuroimaging [Zhao et al 2018; Kang et al 2018, Xue et al 2019] and gene networks in genomics [Cai et al 2017; Cai et al 2019]. Dr Kang’s methods can simultaneously select variables and evaluate the uncertainty of variable selection, as well as make inference on the effect size of the selected variables. His works provide a set of new tools for biomedical researchers to identify important biomarkers using different types of biological knowledge with statistical guarantees. In addition, Dr. Kang’s work is among the first to establish rigorous theoretical justifications for Bayesian spatial variable selection in imaging data analysis [Kang et al 2018] and Bayesian network marker selection in genomics [Cai et al 2019]. Dr. Kang’s theoretical contributions not only offer a deep understanding of the soft-thresholding operator on smooth functions, but also provide insights on which types of the biological knowledge may be useful to improve biomarker detection accuracy. Prior knowledge guided variable screening for ultrahigh-dimensional data Dr. Kang and his colleagues developed a series of variable screening methods for ultrahigh-dimensional data analysis by incorporating the useful prior knowledge in biomedical applications including imaging [Kang et al 2017, He et al 2019], survival analysis [Hong et al 2018] and genomics [He et al 2019]. As a preprocessing step for variable selection, variable screening is a fast-computational approach to dimension reduction. Traditional variable screening methods overlook useful prior knowledge and thus the practical performance is unsatisfying in many biomedical applications. To fill this gap, Dr. Kang developed a partition-based ultrahigh-dimensional variable screening method under generalized linear model, which can naturally incorporate the grouping and structural information in biomedical applications. When prior knowledge is unavailable or unreliable, Dr. Kang proposed a data-driven partition screening framework on covariate grouping and investigate its theoretical properties. The two special cases proposed by Dr. Kang: correlation-guided partitioning and spatial location guided partitioning are practically extremely useful for neuroimaging data analysis and genome-wide association analysis. When multiple types of grouping information are available, Dr. Kang proposed a novel theoretically justified strategy for combining screening statistics from various partitioning methods. It provides a very flexible framework for incorporating different types of prior knowledge. Brain network modeling and inferences Dr. Kang and his colleagues developed several new statistical methods for brain network modeling and inferences using resting-state fMRI data [Kang et al 2016, Xie and Kang 2017, Chen et al 2018]. Due to the high dimensionality of fMRI data (over 100,000 voxels in a standard brain template) with small sample sizes (hundreds of participants in a typical study), it is extremely challenging to model the brain functional connectivity network at voxel-levels. Some existing methods model brain anatomical region-level networks using the region-level summary statistics computed from voxel-level data. Those methods may suffer low power to detect the signals and have an inflated false positive rate, since the summary statistics may not well capture the heterogeneity within the predefined brain regions. To address those limitations, Dr. Kang proposed a novel method based on multi-attribute canonical correlation graphs [Kang et al 2016] to construct region-level brain network using voxel-level data. His method can capture different types of nonlinear dependence between any two brain regions consisting of hundreds or thousands of voxels. He also developed permutation tests for assessing the significance of the estimated network. His methods can largely increase power to detect signals for small sample size problems. In addition, Dr. Kang and his colleague also developed theoretically justified high-dimensional tests [Xie and Kang 2017] for constructing region-level brain networks using the voxel-level data under the multivariate normal assumption. Their theoretical results provide a useful guidance for the future development of statistical methods and theory for brain network analysis. This image illustrates the neuroimaging meta-analysis data (Kang etal 2014). Neuroimaging meta-analysis is an important tool for finding consistent effects over studies. We develop a Bayesian nonparametric model and perform a meta-analysis of five emotions from 219 studies. In addition, our model can make reverse inference by using the model to predict the emotion type from a newly presented study. Our method outperforms other methods with an average of 80% accuracy. 1.

Our research is focused on Post ICU pain syndromes (PIPS). PIPS exhibit distinct phenotypic presentations and can be predicted by intra-ICU parameters. Our primary goal is to be able to predict post-ICU opioid use based on intra-ICU parameters. We utilize a data-driven characterization of post-ICU pain syndromes will utilize unsupervised clustering algorithms including DBSCAN and spectral clustering. Prediction of post-discharge pain severity, likelihood of specific pain presentations, and post-discharge opioid use will be achieved using logistic LASSO, random forests, and neural networks. Specifically, these tests will utilize available ICU data to predict changes between pre- and post-ICU pain severity, incidence of specific pain presentations, and incidence of opioid use. This is a representation of enhancement of human cognition and clinical intelligence with artificial intelligence. Dr. Katz’s research addresses cancer treatment communication, decision-making, and quality of care. His work aims to examine the dynamics of how precision medicine presents itself in the exam room via provider and patient communication and shared decision-making. Dr. Katz leads the Cancer Surveillance and Outcomes Research Team (CanSORT), an interdisciplinary research program centered at the University of Michigan and focused on population and intervention studies of the quality of care and outcomes of cancer detection and treatment in diverse populations.  Dr. Katz and CanSORT have been collaborating with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries since 2002 to study breast cancer treatment decision making at the population level. We obtain patient clinical and demographic information from SEER and combine this with surveys of patients and physicians to create comprehensive data sets that enable us to study testing and treatment trends and the challenges of individualizing treatments for breast cancer patients. In 2015 we added a new dimension to our research by partnering with evaluative testing firms to obtain tumor genomic and germline genetic test results for over 30,000 breast and ovarian cancer patients in the states of California and Georgia. We are also pursuing insurance claims data to assist with our analysis of physician network effects. Steven Katz, MD discusses BRCA and multigene sequence testing at the labs of Ambry Genetics. The primary tools currently in use are variations of linear models (regression, MLM, SEM, and so on) as we pursue the initial aims of the NICHD funded work. We are expanding into new areas that require new tools. Our adolescent sample is diverse, selected through quota sampling of high schools close enough to UM to afford the use of neuroimaging tools, but it is not population representative. To overcome this, we have begun work to calibrate our sample with the nationally representative Monitoring the Future study, implementing pseudo-weighting and multilevel regression and post-stratification. To enable much more powerful analyses, we are aiming toward the harmonization of multiple, high quality longitudinal databases from adolescence through early adulthood. This would benefit traditional analyses by allowing cross-validation with high power, but also provide opportunities for newer data science tools such as computational modeling and machine learning approaches. Our laboratory focuses on (1) the biology of cancer metastasis, especially bone metastasis, including the role of the host microenvironment; and (2) mechanisms of chemoresistance. We explore for genes that regulate metastasis and the interaction between the host microenvironment and cancer cells. We are performing single cell multiomics and spatial analysis to enable us to identify rare cell populations and promote precision medicine. Our research methodology uses a combination of molecular, cellular, and animal studies. The majority of our work is highly translational to provide clinical relevance to our work. In terms of data science, we collaborate on applications of both established and novel methodologies to analyze high dimensional; deconvolution of high dimensional data into a cellular and tissue context; spatial mapping of multiomic data; and heterogenous data integration.

Lagarias is the Harold Mead Stark Collegiate Professor of Mathematics in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Prof. Lagarias’ research interests are diverse. His initial training was in analytic and algebraic number theory. After receiving his PhD in 1974, he worked at Bell Laboratories and AT &T Labs until 2003, on problems in many pure and applied fields. Besides number theory, Prof. Lagarias has made contributions in harmonic analysis (wavelets and fractals), mathematical optimization (interior point methods), discrete geometry (tilings and quasicrystals), ergodic theory, low-dimensional topology (complexity of unknotting), and theoretical computer science. At Michigan Prof. Lagarias has been active in the number theory group over the last few years, with additional work in other fields. His last 25 postings on the arXiv were in: Number Theory (16), Dynamical Systems (3), Classical Analysis and ODE?s (3), Metric Geometry (1), Optimization and Control (1), Spectral Theory (1). His doctoral students typically work on their own topics. Some have worked in topics in number theory: integer factorial ratios, character sum estimates, Diophantine equations with two separated variables; Others have worked in topics in discrete geometry: packings of regular tetrahedra, rigidity of circle configurations. The overarching theme of Carl’s research for the past two decades is interoperability in information systems, spanning the full spectrum of the technical and human components that are critical to create networked information systems that really work. Although the results of this research apply across a variety of information contexts, the primary thread of my research explores information systems to support scholarship and knowledge production. The principal question he asks is: how do we build and sustain cyberinfrastructure that supports the full cycle scholarship and that respects the cultural, methodological, and social variance among fields of scholarship? Some relevant sub questions of this primary issue are: what are the methodological approaches and theoretical foundations relevant to understanding the nuanced variations and scholars’ attitudes towards technical cyberinfrastructure? And: how do we design technical cyberinfrastructure that simultaneously supports large-scale interoperability it respects the diversity scholarship? Finally: How do we accommodate multiple levels of expertise (e.g., citizen scientists) while maintaining quality and integrity? These are essential questions to him “At a time of significant investment in cyberinfrastructure by governments and funders and the emergence of critical scientific questions such as climate change and global pandemics, the investigation of which requires cross-disciplinary collaborations and cyberinfrastructure support.” My research focuses on the use and effectiveness of coaching and appreciation feedback in healthcare. I lead a team that develops a software-based precision feedback system to generate messages about performance to healthcare professionals and teams. My work involves the processing of performance data to detect signals of motivating information that can be delivered with algorithmically prioritized messages, to support performance improvement and sustainment. I lead the DISPLAY-Lab, which collaborates with researchers in a range of clinical and health-related domains, including biomedical informatics, implementation science, and human-centered design. All of my research and administrative projects have a component that focus on improving usability and decreasing burnout for healthcare providers.  We have been able to develop and study several tools that use well-timed and well-designed clinical decision support to improve patient care and decrease risk for patients on high-risk medications.  We have been fortunate to be able to use the data gathered during these implementations to make changes to the interface and workflows to continue to improve patient safety and support providers.  In particular, we are also excited about the potential of layering on a predictive model to help prioritize the alerts that are created for providers; at this time, most facilities do not have the staff to process all the alerts and prioritization is paramount to allow providers to help the most patients in the short amount of time they have. I have been at Michigan Medicine since medical school.  I did OB/GYN residency, REI fellowship here.  I am boarded in clinical informatics.  In 2019, I had the opportunity, given funding and administrative options in informatics, to step away from patient care, so 100% of my time is now focused on informatics projects. Larson’s research has been in the area of “Complex Fluids,” which include polymers, colloids, surfactant-containing fluids, liquid crystals, and biological macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipid membranes. He has also contributed extensively to fluid mechanics, including microfluidics, and transport modeling. He has also has carried out research over the past 16 years in the area of molecular simulations for biomedical applications. The work has involved determining the structure and dynamics of lipid membranes, trans-membrane peptides, anti-microbial peptides, the conformation and functioning of ion channels, interactions of excipients with drugs for drug delivery, interactions of peptides with proteins including MHC molecules, resulting in more than 50 publications in these areas, and in the training of several Ph.D. students and postdocs. Many of these studies involve heavy use of computer simulations and methods of statistical analysis of simulations, including umbrella sampling, forward flux sampling, and metadynamics, which involve statistical weighting of results.

Dr Le is also a member of the UM/Georgetown TCORS Center for the Assessment of Tobacco Regulations (CAsToR). Dr. Le is interested in mathematical modeling for cancer- and tobacco-related problems, and machine-learning applications in tobacco regulatory science. Dr. Le has developed mathematical models to evaluate the benefits and harms of breast cancer mammography and predict the number of white blood cells during acute lymphoblastic maintenance therapy in children. Dr. Le’s recent work focuses on employing mathematical models to quantify the burden of menthol cigarettes on public health and estimate the smoking cessation rate. Dr. Le is working on applying machine learning techniques to predict and understand smoking behaviors. Jon’s research focus is on nonlinear discrete optimization (NDO). Many practical engineering problems have physical aspects which are naturally modeled through smooth nonlinear functions, as well as design aspects which are often modeled with discrete variables. Research in NDO seeks to marry diverse techniques from classical areas of optimization, for example methods for smooth nonlinear optimization and methods for integer linear programming, with the idea of successfully attacking natural NDO models for practical engineering problems.  On particular area of applied interest is environmental monitoring and the framework of maximum-entropy sampling. Dr. Lee’s research interests lie in machine learning and its applications to artificial intelligence. In particular, he focuses on deep learning and representation learning, which aims to learn an abstract representation of the data by a hierarchical and compositional structure. His research also spans over related topics, such as graphical models, optimization, and large-scale learning. Specific application areas include computer vision, audio recognition, robotics, text modeling, and healthcare. My research focuses on issues in data collection with hard-to-reach populations. In particular, she examines 1) nontraditional sampling approaches for minority or stigmatized populations and their statistical properties and 2) measurement error and comparability issues for racial, ethnic and linguistic minorities, which also have implications for cross-cultural research/survey methodology. Most recently, my research has been dedicated to respondent driven sampling that uses existing social networks to recruit participants in both face-to-face and Web data collection settings. I plan to expand my research scope in examining representation issues focusing on the racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S. in the era of big data.

Accomplishments and Awards New U-M study explores video game addiction rates My research interests concern solar magnetism and magnetic flux transport from the convection zone into the corona, and through the heliosphere.In this context, I have contributed to basic theory and modeling efforts with analytical work and large-scale numerical simulations. The topics that I am particularly interested in are: magnetic flux emergence, magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, coronal mass ejection (CME) initiation, propagation, and CME-driven shocks. Flux emergence was the topic of my Ph.D. thesis research, which demonstrated that the expansion of magnetic fields in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere naturally produces Lorentz forces that drive shear flows. These flows lead to the formation of highly energized coronal magnetic fields, which are observed to be at the epicenter of coronal eruptions. This work provides a fundamental explanation for shear flows, which for decades, have been prescribed as ad hoc boundary conditions in numerical models of CMEs, flares and filament eruptions. While at the University of Michigan, I have advanced this fundamental theory of CME initiation by simulating the eruption of both magnetic arcades and flux ropes by such self-induced shear flows. I conceived and implemented the Gibson-Low flux rope as a way of simulating coronal mass ejections and applied this model to study the the propagation of CMEs from the solar corona through the heliosphere. In doing so, many new aspects of CME interaction with the interplanetary medium were discovered. With coauthors, I demonstrated the model’s capability to predict ICME disturbances at Earth, and advised my student, Meng Jin, in developing data-driven tool, EEGGL, which prescribe the model’s parameters and is now installed at CCMC. I am now working with faculty in the University of Michigan Department of Statistics to apply machine learning to classify and predict flare events and to identify the underlying physical processes.

Our research on shared-use mobility systems focuses on peer-to-peer (P2P) ridesharing and multi-modal transportation. We provide: (i) operational tools and decision support systems for shared-use mobility in legacy as well as connected and automated transportation systems. This line of research focuses on system design as well as routing, scheduling, and pricing mechanisms to serve on-demand transportation requests; (ii) insights for regulators and policy makers on mobility benefits of multi-modal transportation; (ii) planning tools that would allow for informed regulations of sharing economy. In another line of research we investigate challenges faced by the connected automated vehicle technology before mass adoption of this technology can occur. Our research mainly focuses on (i) transition of control authority between the human driver and the autonomous entity in semi-autonomous (level 3 SAE autonomy) vehicles; (ii) incorporating network-level information supplied by connected vehicle technology into traditional trajectory planning; (iii) improving vehicle localization by taking advantage of opportunities provided by connected vehicles; and (iv) cybersecurity challenges in connected and automated systems. We seek to quantify the mobility and safety implications of this disruptive technology, and provide insights that can allow for informed regulations. Raj Nadakuditi, PhD, is Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, College of Engineering, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Prof. Nadakuditi received his Masters and PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT as part of the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Ocean Science and Engineering.

Our lab is focused on answering the question-What is the role of tumor microenvironment in modulating cancer cell metabolism? We have developed several metabolic isotope tracing and 13C-based metabolic flux analysis developed in our lab. cells. Notably, we are focusing on personalized metabolic therapy and circulating tumor cell organoids and tumor tissue slices in pancreatic, lung, and breast cancers.

Accomplishments and Awards 22 Indian-origin scientists to take up collaborative research with institutes in country I work in the area of urban sustainability, with research questions at multiple scales and environmental and socio-economic systems. My work uses spatial analysis (esp. GIS and remote sensing) and mass-balance accounting (life cycle assessment, material flow analysis).

Accomplishments and Awards Nearly 15% of Americans Deny Climate Change, Study Finds 2021 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: Using Geospatial Data Science to Identify Vulnerable Communities to Climate Change Urban-grown food’s carbon footprint 6 times larger than typical produce Study examines carbon footprint of urban-farmed food I am broadly interested in statistical inference, which is informally defined as the process of turning data into prediction and understanding. I like to work with richly structured data, such as those extracted from texts, images and other spatiotemporal signals. In recent years I have gravitated toward a field in statistics known as Bayesian nonparametrics, which provides a fertile and powerful mathematical framework for the development of many computational and statistical modeling ideas. My motivation for all this came originally from an early interest in machine learning, which continues to be a major source of research interest. A primary focus of my group’s research in machine learning to develop more effective inference algorithms using stochastic, variational and geometric viewpoints. I try to understand how our tools for determining what is valuable, worthwhile, or good are implicated in patterns of inequality with an acute concern for racial inequality. Often, this means my work investigates the functioning and consequences of a range of scores or ratings, from the less complex government credit ratings to the extremely complex algorithmic scores like consumer credit scores. In related work, as a part of a multi-university team of researchers, I am using administrative credit report data from one of the largest credit reporting agencies to study credit and debt outcomes for millions of consumers in the United States. My research focuses on building infrastructure for public health and health science research organizations to take advantage of cloud computing, strong software engineering practices, and MLOps (machine learning operations). By equipping biomedical research groups with tools that facilitate automation, better documentation, and portable code, we can improve the reproducibility and rigor of science while scaling up the kind of data collection and analysis possible. Research topics include: 1. Open source software and cloud infrastructure for research, 2. Software development practices and conventions that work for academic units, like labs or research centers, and 3. The organizational factors that encourage best practices in reproducibility, data management, and transparency The practice of science is a tug of war between competing incentives: the drive to do a lot fast, and the need to generate reproducible work. As data grows in size, code increases in complexity and the number of collaborators and institutions involved goes up, it becomes harder to preserve all the “artifacts” needed to understand and recreate your own work. Technical AND cultural solutions will be needed to keep data-centric research rigorous, shareable, and transparent to the broader scientific community. View MIDAS Faculty Research Pitch, Fall 2021 My research interests include health effects of air pollution, temperature extremes and climate change (mortality, asthma, hospital admissions, birth outcomes and cardiovascular endpoints); environmental exposure assessment; and socio-economic influences on health. Data science tools and methodologies include geographic information systems and spatio-temporal analysis, epidemiologic study design and data management. Accomplishments and Awards 2021 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: Using Geospatial Data Science to Identify Vulnerable Communities to Climate Change Sally Oey’s group is studying massive star populations and the escape of ionizing radiation from starburst galaxies and super star clusters. The group is at the forefront of establishing a new paradigm for massive-star feedback, where superwinds from compact young star clusters fail to launch. Members have used numerical simulations and image processing techniques to investigate such conditions for allowing ionizing radiation to penetrate the dense gas in star-forming clouds and the interstellar medium in “green pea” galaxies and resolved nearby starbursts. The ionizing radiation may originate from massive binaries and their products, thus group members are carrying out data mining of observational surveys and binary population synthesis models to study how binarity manifests in stellar populations. I lead the Future of Programming Lab (FP Lab), where we design modern user interfaces for modern programming languages. Much of how we program today is rooted in tools designed 40+ years ago, e.g. how we enter code (using simple text editing, which leads to profligate parse errors), how we validate code (using tests or impoverished type systems), how we explore code (in a slow, batched, textual manner), how we communicate change (by throwing away the edits we performed and forcing diff algorithms to guess what we did), and so on. My lab develops new programming language and editor mechanisms, starting from theoretical foundations in mathematics and building up to human interfaces. Integrating live GUIs into programs with holes My research explores the interplay between corporate decisions and employee actions. I currently use anonymized mobile device data to observe individual behaviors, and employ both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. My research focuses on understanding and quantifying climate change impacts on hydroclimatic extremes. From heavy storms and floods to extreme heatwaves and droughts, I study the changing characteristics of these events and their impacts on our daily lives. I use a wide range of data-driven methods such as causal inference, information theory, nonlinear dynamics and machine learning in the analysis of environmental systems. I am primarily interested in using causal inference to obtain new mechanistic insights on the impact of global warming on extreme weather events. My recent work has explored global warming impact on extreme events such as rainfall extremes, using a combination of observations and model simulations. Additionally, recent work has focused on developing new techniques to measure resilience of environmental systems to extreme events, with the ultimate goal of informing mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate change. Map of the Northern Hemisphere showing the projected increase in extreme daily rainfall by 2100 relative to 1950–1979 (the risk ratio). Darker areas are predicted to be more prone to increased rainfall extremes with global warming. What are some of your most interesting projects? Resilience of Watersheds to Extreme Weather and Climate Events: Hydrologic watersheds are the fundamental units of the land surface used in the analysis and management of water resources systems. The response of watersheds to extreme events is highly complex and determined by a multitude of factors, including the presence of dams and reservoirs, snowpack, groundwater-surface water interaction, and vegetation cover, among others. One significant knowledge gap in this field of research is how to objectively and unambiguously quantify the resilience and resistance of watersheds to extreme events, such as droughts and floods. Developing metrics to quantify resilience is of utmost importance, particularly in light of the changing characteristics of extreme events due to global warming. In this project, I employ a wide range of statistical methods to quantify resilience. I then apply methods of machine learning, causal inference, and graph-based techniques to explore patterns of resilience across watersheds worldwide. How did you end up where you are today? I originally hail from Sudan, nestled at the heart of Africa. Growing up along the banks of the Nile River, I developed an early fascination with water and its profound connection to humanity. On one hand, it provides people with their needs for drinking, agriculture, transportation, and recreation. On the other hand, an excess or shortage of water often results in devastating natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, and famines. Throughout antiquity, humans have endeavored to regulate rivers by building dams, canals, and various other structures. This deep-seated interest in water sciences and related engineering disciplines led me to pursue a degree in Civil Engineering. Following my college graduation, I chose to embark on graduate studies to delve deeper into the intricate relationship between climate change and the water cycle. Embarking on an arduous 18-hour flight, I traversed the vast Atlantic Ocean and the continental expanse of the United States to arrive in California, the Golden State. There, I successfully completed my MSc and PhD degrees at the University of California, Irvine, in just under five years. Subsequently, I relocated northward to Berkeley, where I conducted my postdoctoral research, focusing on the impact of global warming on climate extreme events. I come to University of Michigan with a deep research interest in exploring the impact of global warming on extreme events and the resilience of ecosystems to such events. My research group harness recent advances in data science (machine learning, causal inference and information theory) to obtain new mechanistic and predictive insights on these questions with the ultimate goal of informing climate change adaptation strategies.

Accomplishments and Awards Three faculty members, 27 students awarded Fulbrights Luis Ortiz, PhD, is Assistant Professor of Computer and Information Science, College of Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Michigan, Dearborn The study of large complex systems of structured strategic interaction, such as economic, social, biological, financial, or large computer networks, provides substantial opportunities for fundamental computational and scientific contributions. Luis’ research focuses on problems emerging from the study of systems involving the interaction of a large number of “entities,” which is my way of abstractly and generally capturing individuals, institutions, corporations, biological organisms, or even the individual chemical components of which they are made (e.g., proteins and DNA). Current technology has facilitated the collection and public availability of vasts amounts of data, particularly capturing system behavior at fine levels of granularity. In Luis’ group, they study behavioral data of strategic nature at big data levels. One of their main objectives is to develop computational tools for data science, and in particular learning large-population models from such big sources of behavioral data that we can later use to study, analyze, predict and alter future system behavior at a variety of scales, and thus improve the overall efficiency of real-world complex systems (e.g., the smart grid, social and political networks, independent security and defense systems, and microfinance markets, to name a few).

Accomplishments and Awards 2023 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: Foundations of Sequence Models for Learning, Estimation, and Control of Dynamical Systems. Necmiye Ozay, PhD, is Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, College of Engineering, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Prof. Ozay and her team develop the scientific foundations and associated algorithmic tools for compactly representing and analyzing heterogeneous data streams from sensor/information-rich networked dynamical systems. They take a unified dynamics-based and data-driven approach for the design of passive and active monitors for anomaly detection in such systems. Dynamical models naturally capture temporal (i.e., causal) relations within data streams. Moreover, one can use hybrid and networked dynamical models to capture, respectively, logical relations and interactions between different data sources. They study structural properties of networks and dynamics to understand fundamental limitations of anomaly detection from data. By recasting information extraction problem as a networked hybrid system identification problem, they bring to bear tools from computer science, system and control theory and convex optimization to efficiently and rigorously analyze and organize information. The applications include diagnostics, anomaly and change detection in critical infrastructure such as building management systems, transportation and energy networks.

My research examines the social media behavior of politicians. Using machine learning methods to curate lists of Twitter accounts by class, such as politicians, journalists, influencers, etc, I research temporal and topical patterns of how political communication – including campaign outreach, network alignments, hate speech, and polarization play out online before, during, and after major electoral campaigns. My work is primarily based on Twitter data, using the Twitter academic API to pull amd store tweets of accounts identified through an iterative process of shortlisting handles of interest. Thereafter, we use amix of descriptives and advanced statistical techniques to seek patterns in the data. My research is mainly concerned with theoretical and computational hydrodynamics, with applications in nonlinear ocean wave prediction and dynamics, wave-body interactions, and wave turbulence theory. I have incorporated the data science tools in my research, especially in the following two projects: 1. Quantification of statistics of extreme ship motions in irregular wave fields: In this project, we propose a new computational framework that directly resolves the statistics (and causal factors) of extreme ship responses in a nonlinear wave field. The development leverages a range of physics and learning based approaches, including nonlinear wave simulations (potential flow), ship response simulations (e.g., CFD), dimension-reduction techniques, sequential sampling, Gaussian process regression (Kriging) and multi-fidelity methods. The key features of the new approach include (i) description of the stochastic wave field by a low-dimensional probabilistic parameter space, and (ii) use of minimum number of CFD simulations to provide most information for converged statistics of extreme motions. 2. Real-time wave prediction with data assimilation from radar measurements: In this project, we develop the real-time data assimilation algorithm adapted to the CPU-GPU hardware architecture, to reduce the uncertainties associated with radar measurement errors and environmental factors such as wind and current in the realistic ocean environment. Upon integration with advanced in-situ or remote wave sensing technology, the developed computational framework can provide heretofore unavailable real-time forecast capability for ocean waves. Dimitra Panagou’s research lies in the areas of multi-agent systems and control, with applications in multi-robot/vehicle systems. She is particularly interested in establishing safety and resilience against adversity and uncertainty for multi-robot/vehicle systems using techniques from (networked) control theory, estimation theory, and machine learning. My main research interest is in quantum gravity. Various aspects of quantum information and quantum chaotic systems have proven to be essential in recent developments. 3D reconstruction and generative models. I use neural and physical 3D representations to generate realistic 3D objects and scenes. The current focus is large-scale, dynamic, and interactable 3D scene generations. These generative models will be greatly useful for content creators, like games or movies, or for autonomous agent training in virtual environments. For my research, I frequently use and adopt generative modeling techniques such as auto-decoders, GANs, or Diffusion Models. In my project “DeepSDF,” I suggested a new representation for a 3D generative model that made a breakthrough in the field. The question I answered is: “what should the 3D model be generating? Points, meshes, or voxels?” In DeepSDF paper, I proposed that we should generate a “function,” that takes input as a 3D coordinate and outputs a field value corresponding to that coordinate, where the “function” is represented as a neural network. This neural coordinate-based representation is memory-efficient, differentiable, and expressive, and is at the core of huge progress our community has made for 3D generative modeling and reconstruction. 3D faces with apperance and geometry generated by our AI model Two contributions I would like to make. First, I would like to enable AI generation of large-scale, dynamic, and interactable 3D world, which will benefit entertainment, autonomous agent training (robotics and self-driving) and various other scientific fields such as 3D medical imaging. Second, I would like to devise a new and more efficient neural network architecture that mimics our brains better. The current AI models are highly inefficient in terms of how they learn from data (requires a huge number of labels), difficult to train continuously and with verbal/visual instructions. I would like to develop a new architecture and learning methods that address these current limitations.

Accomplishments and Awards 2022 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: A Machine-Learning Approach to Reduce Uncertainty in Climate Forcing by Aerosols My group is deeply involved in building, operating and analyzing the data of the world’s most sensitive dark matter detectors. We reached the sensitivity to detect quanta, therefore generating a very large amount of very complex data, containing novel signatures and hopefully to discover dark matter. Modern machine learning and data science methods allow us to analyze these data sets unprecedented sensitivity and to also gain new insights and potential discoveries in astroparticle, nuclear physics and neutrino physics. My research fields are investigations of the mechanical and chemical properties of materials by applying theoretical and computational tools, including first-principles calculations, atomistic simulations, multiscale modeling, and how to apply machine learning to overcome the size/time scale limitations that widely exist in these computational studies. As shown in the following picture, a recent example of my research is to construct the physics-informed machine learning surrogate model to quickly predict material parameters related to their strength and ductility, otherwise, these parameters can only obtain from costly first-principles calculations and/or atomistic simulations.

Accomplishments and Awards 2022 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: Machine Learning Guided Co-design for Reconstructive Spectroscopy Our research group studies how and why an organism’s traits (“phenotypes”) evolve in natural populations. Explaining the mechanisms that generate and regulate patterns of phenotypic diversity is a major goal of evolutionary biology: why do we see rapid shifts to strikingly new and distinct character states, and how stable are these evolutionary transitions across space and time? To answer these questions, we generate and analyze high-throughput “big data” on both genomes and phenotypes across the 18,000 species of reptiles and amphibians across the globe. Then, we use the statistical tools of phylogenetic comparative analysis, geometric morphometrics of 3D anatomy generated from CT scans, and genome annotation and comparative transcriptomics to understand the integrated trait correlations that create complex phenotypes. Currently, we are using machine learning and neural networks to study the color patterns of animals vouchered into biodiversity collections and test hypotheses about the ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of phenotypic innovation. We are especially passionate about the effective and accurate visualization of large-scale multidimensional datasets, and we prioritize training in both best practices and new innovations in quantitative data display. The Rabosky lab seeks to understand how and why life on Earth became so diverse. We focus primarily on large-scale patterns of species diversification (speciation and extinction) and on the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution, to better understand what regulates the “amount” of biodiversity through Deep Time. To this end, we develop theoretical frameworks and computational tools for studying evolutionary dynamics using DNA-sequence-based evolutionary trees (phylogenies), the fossil record, as well as phenotypic data from present-day species (morphology, ecology). We develop and apply a range of methods involving supervised and unsupervised learning, including Markov chain Monte Carlo, hierarchical mixture models, hidden Markov models, latent feature models, and more. We are increasingly interested in complex morphological and ecological traits, which – due to a rapidly expanding data universe – represent a tremendous opportunity for the field to answer long-standing questions about how organisms evolve. At these same time, we are embracing the analytical challenges of these data, because fully realizing their potential requires the development of new analytical paradigms that go beyond the limitations of traditional parametric models for low-dimensional data. Automatic feature identification from a large-scale evolutionary tree (phylogeny) using a compound model of the generating process (speciation, extinction) developed in the Rabosky lab. Colors correspond to distinct evolutionary rate regimes as estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo. This method revealed widespread heterogeneity in the rate of species formation during 350 million years of ray-finned fish evolution. Warm colors = fast rates; cool colors = slow rates.

We have developed novel content analysis approaches to understand the experience of young children while using commercially available mobile apps – including advertising content, educational quality, and data collection. We emphasize questions that are relevant to everyday parenting experiences, and also consider what design changes would help create an optimal default environment for children and families.

The model-based approach provides a framework to incorporate all the relevant sampling design features in dealing with unit and item nonresponse in sample surveys. There are important computational challenges in implementing these methods in practical surveys. He has developed SAS based software, IVEware, for performing multiple imputation analysis and the analysis of complex survey data. Raghunathan’s other research interests include Bayesian methods, methods for small area estimation, combining information from multiple surveys, measurement error models, longitudinal data analysis, privacy, confidentiality and disclosure limitations and statistical methods for epidemiological studies.

This involves large scale computations accounting for detailed behavior of the chaotic turbulent flow in these systems, combined with enabling science in computational chemistry and algorithms. One aspect of my research is the prediction of rare events that lead to catastrophic system failure (as in flight crash, engine failure etc.). This work also involves the understanding of uncertainty in models, and streamlining knowledge in the form of mathematical models. My research focuses on the intersection of translational medicine, device innovation, and clinical trial design, leveraging advanced data science methodologies to improve patient outcomes in nephrology and vascular access. Specifically, I apply machine learning, predictive analytics, and real-world evidence methodologies to enhance the effectiveness of novel medical devices and optimize clinical workflows. My work also includes AI-driven decision support systems to enhance treatment pathways while addressing health disparities by ensuring diverse, representative datasets. Additionally, I also collaborate with deep learning techniques for medical imaging analysis, particularly in the automated evaluation of dialysis vascular access patency and thrombotic risk prediction. Through these data science-driven approaches, my goal is to advance precision medicine in nephrology, accelerate medical device innovation, and improve the quality of care for patients with kidney disease and related conditions. One of my most exciting projects is CORE (“COnnecting REsearch”), an innovative software platform that democratizes clinical trials by leveraging AI and machine learning to optimize trial design, recruitment, and retention. CORE intelligently matches participants with clinical trials based on eligibility, demographics, and preferences, ensuring a more inclusive and efficient recruitment process. By reducing participant burden and enhancing accessibility, it improves the clinical trial experience while increasing diversity and representation in research. CORE also integrates AI-driven predictive analytics to refine clinical trial design, optimizing site selection, patient stratification, and adaptive trial methodologies. By harnessing real-world data, it helps sponsors enhance recruitment, reduce costs, and improve retention—leading to more efficient, generalizable, and impactful trial outcomes. Ultimately, CORE bridges the gap between researchers and participants, transforming clinical research accessibility and equity. My research journey has been driven by a deep passion for translational medicine, medical device innovation, and health equity. Early in my career, I recognized the significant gaps in access, efficiency, and diversity in clinical trials and patient care, particularly in nephrology and vascular access. This led me to explore data science and AI-driven solutions to improve clinical workflows, optimize device efficacy, and enhance patient outcomes. Following which my work on catheter-associated infections, dialysis vascular access, and acute kidney injury reinforced the need for more inclusive and efficient research methodologies, inspiring me to develop CORE (“COnnecting REsearch”)—a platform that democratizes clinical trials using AI-powered participant matching and trial optimization. Through a combination of clinical expertise, data science methodologies, and a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), I have built a research portfolio that bridges technology and patient care, ensuring that innovation in medicine is accessible, equitable, and impactful.

The capacity to predict student success depends in part on our ability to understand “educationally purposeful” student behaviors and motivations and the relationship between behaviors and motivations and academic achievement. My research focuses on how to collect student behaviors germane to learning at a higher granularity and analyze the relationships between student performance and behaviors. Ultimately this research is aimed at designing and constructing an “earlier warning system” wherein student guidance is quasi-automated and informed by motivation, background and behaviors and delivered within weeks of the beginning of classes. 9.9.2020 MIDAS Faculty Research Pitch Video.

Accomplishments and Awards Dworkin, Sandvig receive 2023 public engagement awards Dr. Saran is an internationally recognized expert in kidney disease research – specifically, in the area of kidney disease surveillance and epidemiology. From 2014 – 2019, he served as Director of the United States Renal Data System (USRDS; www.usrds.org), a ‘gold standard’ for kidney disease data systems, worldwide. Since 2006 he has been Co-Principal Investigator for the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National CKD Surveillance System for the US, a one of a kind project that complements the USRDS, while focusing on upstream surveillance of CKD and its risk factors (www.cdc.org/ckd/surveillance). Both projects have influenced policy related to kidney disease in the US and were cited extensively in the July 2019 Advancing American Kidney Health Federal policy document. Dr. Saran led the development of the first National Kidney Disease Information System (VA-REINS), for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), funded by the VA’s Center for Innovation, and one that led to the VA recognizing the importance of kidney disease as a health priority for US veterans. Dr. Saran has recently (2018-2021) been funded on a spin off project from VA REINS for investigation of ‘hot-spot’ of kidney disease among US Veterans involving both risk-prediction and geospatial analyses – a modern approach to health system big data being used for prevention and population health improvement, using kidney disease as an example. This approach has broad application for prevention and optimizing management of major chronic diseases. Accomplishments and Awards Mapping the Overlap of Poverty Level and Prevalence of Diagnosed Chronic Kidney Disease Among Medicare Beneficiaries in the United States My lab has two main areas of focus: molecular characteristics of head and neck cancer, and the intersection of regulatory genomics and pathway analysis. With head and neck cancer, we study tumor subtypes and biomarkers of prognosis, treatment response, and recurrence. We perform integrative omics analyses, dimension reduction methods, and prediction techniques, with the ultimate goal of identifying patient subsets who would benefit from either an additional targeted treatment or de-escalated treatment to increase quality of life.

Matthew Schipper, PhD, is Professor in the Departments of Radiation Oncology and Biostatistics. He received his Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan in 2006. Prior to joining the Radiation Oncology department he was a Research Investigator in the Department of Radiology at the University of Michigan and a consulting statistician at Innovative Analytics. Prof. Schipper’s research interests include: Use of Biomarkers to Individualize Treatment – Selection of dose for cancer patients treated with Radiation Therapy (RT) must balance the increased efficacy with the increased toxicity associated with higher dose. Historically, a single dose has been selected for a population of patients (e.g. all stage III NSC lung cancer). However, the availability of new biologic markers for toxicity and efficacy allow the possibility of selecting a more personalized dose. I am interested in using statistical models for toxicity and efficacy as a function of RT dose and biomarkers to select an optimal dose for an individual patient. We are studying quantitative methods based on utilities to make this efficacy/toxicity tradeoff explicit and quantitative when biomarkers for one or multiple outcomes are available. We have proposed a simulation based method for studying the likely effects of any model or marker based dose selection on both toxicity and efficacy outcomes for a population of patients. In related projects, we are studying the role of correlation between the sensitivity of a patient’ tumor and normal tissues to radiation. We are also studying how to utilize these techniques in combination with baseline and/or mid-treatment adaptive image guided RT. Early Phase Oncology Study Design – An increasingly common feature of phase I designs is the inclusion of 1 or more dose expansion cohorts (DECs) in which the MTD is first estimated using a 3+3 or other Phase I design and then a fixed number (often 10-20 in 1-10 cohorts) of patients are treated at the dose initially estimated to be the MTD. Such an approach has not been studied statistically or compared to alternative designs. We have shown that a CRM design, in which the dose-assignment mechanism is kept active for all patients, more accurately identifies the MTD and protects the safety of trial patients than a similarly sized DEC trial. It also meets the objective of treating 15 or more patients at the final estimated MTD.  A follow-up paper evaluating the role of DECs with a focus on efficacy estimation is in press at Annals of Oncology. The Schloss lab is broadly interested in beneficial and pathogenic host-microbiome interactions with the goal of improving our understanding of how the microbiome can be used to reach translational outcomes in the prevention, detection, and treatment of colorectal cancer, Crohn’s disease, and Clostridium difficile infection. To address these questions, we test traditional ecological theory in the microbial context using a systems biology approach. Specifically, the laboratory specializes in using studies involving human subjects and animal models to understand how biological diversity affects community function using a variety of culture-independent genomics techniques including sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. In addition, they use metabolomics to understand the functional role of the gut microbiota in states of health and disease. To support these efforts, they develop and apply bioinformatic tools to facilitate their analysis. Most notable is the development of the mothur software package (https://www.mothur.org), which is one of the most widely used tools for analyzing microbiome data and has been cited more than 7,300 times since it was initially published in 2009. The Schloss lab deftly merges the ability to collect data to answer important biological questions using cutting edge wet-lab techniques and computational tools to synthesize these data to answer their biological questions. Given the explosion in microbiome research over the past 15 years, the Schloss lab has also stood at the center of a major effort to train interdisciplinary scientists in applying computational tools to study complex biological systems. These efforts have centered around developing reproducible research skills and applying modern data visualization techniques. An outgrowth of these efforts at the University of Michigan has been the institutionalization of The Carpentries organization on campus (https://carpentries.org), which specializes in peer-to-peer instruction of programming tools and techniques to foster better reproducibility and build a community of practitioners. The Schloss lab uses computational tools to integrate multi-omics tools in a culture-independent approach to understand how bacteria interact with each other and their host to drive processes such as colorectal cancer and susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infections. The current goal of our research is to learn enough about the physiology and ecology of microbes and microbial communities in the gut that we are able to engineer the gut microbiome to improve human health. The first target of our engineering is the production of butyrate – a common fermentation product of some gut microbes that is essential for human health. Butyrate is the preferred energy source for mitochondria in the epithelial cells lining the gut and it also regulates their gene expression. One of the most effective ways to influence the composition and metabolism of the gut microbiota is through diet. In an interventional study, we have tracked responses in the composition and fermentative metabolism of the gut microtiota in &gt;800 healthy individuals. Emerging patterns suggest several configurations of the microbiome that can result in increased production of butyrate acid. We have isolated the microbes that form an anaerobic food web to convert dietary fiber to butyrate and continue to make discoveries about their physiology and interactions. Based on these results, we have initiated a clinical trial in which we are hoping to prevent the development of Graft versus Host Disease following bone marrow transplants by managing butyrate production by the gut microbiota. We are also beginning to track hundreds of other metabolites from the gut microbiome that may influence human health. We use metagenomes and metabolomes to identify patterns that link the microbiota with their metabolites and then test those models in human organoids and gnotobiotic mice colonized with synthetic communities of microbes. This blend of wet-lab research in basic microbiology, data science and in ecology is moving us closer to engineering the gut microbiome to improve human health.

My research is at the intersection of Science of Science + Sociology of Organizations + Computational Social Science. I study how social and organizational factors affect scientific discovery. I am especially interested in evaluation practices in science, and whether they promote or stifle innovation. My approach relies primarily on field experiments — interventions in scientific competitions and other settings — and applying computational tools to large-scale observational data. Current research projects include: 1. Cumulative advantage in science: Do metrics like citation counts and impact factors proxy quality and influence, or help create them? 2. Biases in expert evaluation: Do groups of experts make decisions differently from individuals? 3. Science and the media: What research is picked up by the media, and how is it covered? Showing how often a paper has been cited causes scientists to perceive it as of lower quality, unless that paper is among the 10% most highly cited. Accomplishments and Awards Researchers with African and East Asian names are less likely to be mentioned in U.S. media A simulation-based analysis of the impact of rhetorical citations in science My research focuses on leveraging language models to enable concurrent, embedded and transformative assessment processes for learners and their educational journeys. Traditional assessment approaches are primarily summative, placing students in high-pressure exam situations that may not accurately reflect their abilities or learning progression. These assessments tend to follow a “one size fits all” model, neglecting the diverse needs and backgrounds of individual learners. Consequently, such approaches can contribute to educational inequities, diminish student motivation, overlook diversity, and offer insufficient feedback for guiding further learning. There’s a pressing need for a system that supports personalized formative assessment, promotes continuous educational growth, and remains scalable and efficient. In contrast, the systems I develop create “bespoke assessments” tailored to each student’s unique educational context — considering their background, experiences, and current level of understanding. By providing real-time, relevant, and personalized feedback, these systems facilitate more accurate and supportive evaluation of student learning. My research lies at the confluence of learning sciences, data science, and social learning, with a strong emphasis on design-based implementation. I focus on designing and deploying advanced educational technologies that enhance and support student learning experiences. I develop probabilistic and statistical models to analyze genetic and genomic data. We use these methods to study evolution, natural selection, and human history. Recently, I have been interested in applying these techniques to study viral epidemics (e.g., HIV) and cancer. Estimates of recent effective population sizes for various human subpopulations. My research group is engaged in fundamental research in the following areas: Statistical learning theory: We are developing theory and algorithms for predictions problems (e.g., learning to rank and multilabel learning) with complex label spaces and where the available human supervision is often weak. Sequential prediction in a game theoretic framework: We are trying to understand the power and limitations of sequential predictions algorithms when no probabilistic assumptions are placed on the data generating mechanism. High dimensional and network data analysis: We are developing scalable algorithms with provable performance guarantees for learning from high dimensional and network data. Optimization algorithms: We are creating incremental, distributed and parallel algorithms for machine learning problems arising in today’s data rich world. Reinforcement learning: We are synthesizing concepts and techniques from artificial intelligence, control theory and operations research for pushing the frontier in sequential decision making with a focus on delivering personalized health interventions via mobile devices.

Dr. Thomer received her doctorate in Library and Information Science from the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign in 2017. One branch of my research considers how to use data and models to improve manufacturing productivity. We look at how to capture streaming data from the factory floor, put it together with models encapsulated in “digital twins”, and use the predictions to better schedule production, plan maintenance, detect anomalies (including cyber-attacks), reconfigure the manufacturing system or supply chain to react to disturbances, and improve quality. We use models based on physics, subject-matter expertise, and historical data. We partner with various companies and industries to understand the needs and opportunities. Another branch of my research considers how to improve the performance of human-robot teams through modeling and feedback. We run user studies with semi-automated vehicles and robots, and ask humans to work together with the automation to accomplish tasks. We collect physiological and behavioral data, build models of trust and situation awareness, and adapt the automation to enhance the overall team performance. Models are built using historical data and are informed by existing literature. Accomplishments and Awards Robotics leader Dawn Tilbury elected to National Academy of Engineering My research utilizes computational social science and artificial intelligence to derive contextually informed algorithmic frameworks for understanding individuals and the social systems which influence their behavior, and for supporting positive behavior change within these systems. In particular, I analyze policy and behavior, and apply interactive behavior support and predictive algorithms, within the areas of higher education, environmental sustainability, and political participation. Individuals are increasing spend their time in quasi-digital environments generating a wealth of data traces with which to understand their behavior. However, this data can produce its own set of challenges (sparsity, heterogeneity, connectivity) and generating new understandings of human behavior necessitates novel statistical and computational approaches. In my work I address these challenges by developing probabilistic frameworks which can capitalize on structure between data instances, producing state-of-the-art performance in tasks from predicting household appliance energy consumption with an energy disaggregation framework to predicting the movements of human traffickers.

Accomplishments and Awards AI guardrails can fall short in health care: study The focus of the research in our group is two fold. 1) We use stellar kinematics in galactic nuclei to infer the masses of super massive black holes using dynamical modeling. This includes a combination of statistical and optimization methods to fit data from telescopes such as the James Webb Space telescope. My group also uses galactic dynamical simulations to study the effects that black holes have on their host galaxies and statistical methods to compare observed galaxies with simulations. 2) We construct dynamical models of the Milky Way to understand its structure, dynamics and formation history. We construct models with 9-dimensional data (3D positions, 3D velocities, iron-abundance, alpha-element abundance, age) for tens of millions of individual stars in the Milky Way to constrain the properties of dark matter. Dark matter is the substance that constitute 85-90% of the mass budget in the Universe but is still undetected. The data science methods used here including unsupervised learning to identify clusters in 6D-9D phase space – which enables us to identify the satellites that built up the Milky Way and the nature of the dark matter in these satellites, Bayesian inference to constrain the nature of dark matter by characterizing the structure of tidal streams, deep learning to infer properties like ages and distances of stars from their spectra.

To this end, my work focuses on developing a more fundamental understanding of the early stages of the design process to improve design practice and pedagogy, and also improve the tools with which designers of complex systems work. I am particularly interested in developing novel approaches for gathering both qualitative and quantitative data generated throughout the design processes of complex systems and using this data to improve design outcomes. In my work, I focus on three main research questions: How can a fundamental understanding of design be used to improve design practice, design tools, and engineering pedagogy? How can design processes be made more open and participatory such that epistemic plurality and inclusivity are achieved as part of the design process? How can insights from design research be applied to the designs of policies and institutions for the governance — both innovation and regulation — of nuclear technologies? Image: The Sociotechnical Readiness Level, which is a framework which critiques and reimagines the traditional Technology Readiness Level Framework. As part of the new SRL framework, we are developing new metrics and indicators to measure both social and technical aspects of a technology’s readiness throughout its design and development process. What are some of your most interesting projects? Two new projects I am most excited about are (1) developing a sociotechnical readiness level framework for the assessment of novel technologies and (2) diagnosing the causes of cost overruns in the early stages of technology design. In the first project, we are critiquing and reimagining the traditional Technology Readiness Level framework to capture both societal and engineering aspects of a technology’s readiness and integrate them into a single framework. As part of this work, we will develop metrics and indicators for assessing a technology’s readiness across the nine levels of sociotechnical readiness. In the second project, we are studying how decisions made in the early stages of design impact overall system cost. This work is especially crucial in a nuclear energy context because recent nuclear plant construction projects have been severely impacted by cost overruns as well as project delays. It is vitally important to diagnose the causes of these cost overruns and address them in the early stages of the design if nuclear reactors are to play a significant role in our low-carbon energy systems. How did you end up where you are today? I was drawn to the field of nuclear engineering because of the enormous potential nuclear technologies have for solving one of the grandest challenges of our time: access to reliable, clean, and abundant energy. What is the most significant scientific contribution you would like to make? I hope to develop a deeper and more fundamental understanding of the design processes of complex systems that leads to more creative, robust, societally, and environmentally beneficial design outcomes. What makes you excited about your data science and AI research? There is an enormous opportunity to use data science and AI to study the early stages of the design processes of complex systems and develop new tools to stimulate a broader exploration of the design space and to ensure better design outcomes. What are 1-3 interesting facts about yourself? I love learning new languages. Depending on how you count, I speak (with varying levels of ability) six (or seven). The Violi Lab carries out cross-disciplinary research at the intersection of nanoscience and data science. By integrating machine learning techniques with molecular simulations, the team strives to unravel fundamental scientific principles while tackling practical problems in material science, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. Their methodological toolkit encompasses various cutting-edge approaches: active learning and Bayesian experimental design to improve sample efficiency; advanced gradient boosting techniques for predictive modeling; specialized neural networks to decode protein-nanoparticle interactions; and Lasso-like algorithms for feature selection and regularization. Through this integrated approach, the lab aims to make significant contributions to both scientific understanding and technological innovation. Research on computational modeling of energy materials design and optimization 1) I led this large research project on developing machine-learning guided materials discovery demonstrating speed-up of over 80% over traditional methods. 2) My research group runs a popular Scientific Machine Learning webinar series: https://micde.umich.edu/news-events/sciml-webinar-series/ V.G.Vinod Vydiswaran, PhD, is Assistant Professor in the Department of Learning Health Sciences with a secondary appointment in the School of Information at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Dr. Vydiswaran’s research focuses on developing and applying text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning methodologies for extracting relevant information from health-related text corpora. This includes medically relevant information from clinical notes and biomedical literature, and studying the information quality and credibility of online health communication (via health forums and tweets).

His research is in the area of survey nonresponse and methods for addressing it during data collection. He has co-authored a book on adaptive survey design — which is a set of methods that aims to optimize the recruitment of heterogeneous samples to participate in surveys. He has a strong focus on measures of data quality, particularly related to missing data. He is currently UM-PI for the Army study to Assess Risk & Resilience in Servicemembers — Longitudinal Study. This is a panel study of mental health among soldiers and veterans. The study involves the linkage of survey and administrative data in order to predict mental health outcomes. He is also a co-developer for a Coursera course on data quality. The course covers methods for identifying, measuring, and correcting error in data gathered from surveys, administrative data, and other sources. He has had a focus on multiple aspects of data quality — a “total data quality” perspective. He believes that this perspective can be helpful as a conceptual framework for those working across data from multiple sources. I use machine-learning techniques to implement decision support systems and tools that facilitate more personalized care for disease management and healthcare utilization to ultimately deliver efficient, effective, and equitable therapy for chronic diseases. To test and advance these general principles, I have built operational programs that are guiding—and improving—patient care in costly in low resource settings, including emerging countries. Nils G. Walter, PhD, is the Francis S. Collins Collegiate Professor of Chemistry, Biophysics and Biological Chemistry, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and Professor of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Nature and Nanotechnology likewise employ nanoscale machines that self-assemble into structures of complex architecture and functionality.  Fluorescence microscopy offers a non-invasive tool to probe and ultimately dissect and control these nanoassemblies in real-time.  In particular, single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) allows us to measure distances at the 2-8 nm scale, whereas complementary super-resolution localization techniques based on Gaussian fitting of imaged point spread functions (PSFs) measure distances in the 10 nm and longer range.  In terms of Big Data Analysis, we have developed a method for the intracellular single molecule, high-resolution localization and counting (iSHiRLoC) of microRNAs (miRNAs), a large group of gene silencers with profound roles in our body, from stem cell development to cancer.  Microinjected, singly-fluorophore labeled, functional miRNAs are tracked at super-resolution within individual diffusing particles.  Observed mobility and mRNA dependent assembly changes suggest the existence of two kinetically distinct assembly processes.  We are currently feeding these data into a single molecule systems biology pipeline to bring into focus the unifying molecular mechanism of such a ubiquitous gene regulatory pathway.  In addition, we are using cluster analysis of smFRET time traces to show that large RNA processing machines such as single spliceosomes – responsible for the accurate removal of all intervening sequences (introns) in pre-messenger RNAs – are working as biased Brownian ratchet machines.  On the opposite end of the application spectrum, we utilize smFRET and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to monitor enhanced enzyme cascades and nanorobots engineered to self-assemble and function on DNA origami.

Naisyin Wang, PhD, is Professor of Statistics, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Prof. Wang’s main research interests involve developing models and methodologies for complex biomedical data. She has developed approaches in information extraction from imperfect data due to measurement errors and incompleteness. Her other methodology developments include model-based mixture modeling, non- and semiparametric modeling of longitudinal, dynamic and high dimensional data. She developed approaches that first gauge the effects of measurement errors on non-linear mixed effects models and provided statistical methods to analyze such data. Most methods she has developed are so called semi-parametric based. One strength of such approaches is that one does not need to make certain structure assumptions about part of the model. This modeling strategy enables data integration from measurements collected from sources that might not be completely homogeneous. Her recently developed statistical methods focus on regularized approach and model building, selection and evaluation for high dimensional, dynamic or functional data. Regularized time-varying ODE coefficients of SEI dynamic equation for the Canadian measles incidence data (Li, Zhu, Wang, 2015). Left panel: time-varying ODE coefficient curve that reflects both yearly and seasonal effects with the regularized yearly effect (red curve) embedded; right panel: regularized (red curve), non-regularized (blue) and two-year local constant (circles) estimates of yearly effects. The new regularized method shows that the yearly effect is relatively large in the early years and deceases gradually to a constant after 1958. I am broadly interested in the economics of sports. My current research focuses primarily on two areas, two-sided markets and antitrust policy. Using e-commerce and social media data, I study the effect on consumer and social welfare when sports consumption move from traditional markets to the internet. My research is to support more people learn in effective ways. I draw techniques and theories from Human-Computer Interaction, Learning Sciences, and Artificial Intelligence to develop computational methods and systems to support scalable teaching and learning. There are several directions in my research that draw on data science techniques and also contribute to interdisciplinary data science research, 1) data-driven authoring techniques of intelligent tutoring systems, with application domains in UX education and data science education 2) AI-augmented instructional design and the use Human-AI collaborative techniques in instructional design.

Dr. Wentao Wang is currently a research faculty in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States. He obtained his Ph.D. degree in 2016 from Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Hui Li and Prof. Jerome P. Lynch Lu’s research is focused on natural language processing, computational social science, and machine learning. More specifically, Lu works on algorithms for text summarization, language generation, argument mining, information extraction, and discourse analysis, as well as novel applications that apply such techniques to understand media bias and polarization and other interdisciplinary subjects. Runzi Wang is a transdisciplinary researcher who studies change in natural and urban environments across space and over time, with the objective of driving positive change with ecological planning and design strategies. Combining technologies such as big data, machine learning, remote sensing, and spatial statistics, her primary research explores how land cover change and urban development pattern influence stream water quality and stormwater quality at the watershed basis, together with various environmental, climatic, and sociocultural factors. By enhancing the interpretability of machine learning in its application to landscape architecture, the most innovative part of her research is to uncover the nonlinear, interacted relationships between environmental, technological, and sociocultural dimensions of landscape systems. What are some of your most interesting projects? I conducted the first continental-scale urban stream water quality study funded by MIDAS. We applied geospatial analysis to investigate the characteristics of the built environment (e.g., building footprint, street length, land use spatial pattern) associated with urban stream water quality, the social inequities regarding exposure to stream water contamination, as well as the spatial variations in the above processes. We developed data integration protocols for data from remote sensing products, in-situ observations, and the US Census Bureau. Using Bayesian hierarchical models, we concluded that watersheds with a higher percentage of minorities are associated with higher nutrient pollution, with the relationship being more significant in the American Northwest. I investigated how land use planning and best management practices mitigated climate change effects on Lake Erie’s water quality. With the integration of longitudinal watershed land cover, agricultural, and climatic data from 1985-2017, we found that no-tillage and reduced tillage management were effective mitigation strategies that could decrease water quality sensitivity to climate change. We plan to advance this work by fusing remote sensing-based bloom detection and process-based simulation to investigate how climate change, land cover change, and anthropogenic activities will impact the eutrophication of Lake Erie. How did you end up where you are today? I have a highly interdisciplinary background, receiving training in architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, statistics, hydrology and water quality, and broader social science topics. This forms my research topic to study the relationships between people, land, and water. Specifically, I study the interconnectedness between people living in the watershed, the land use and urban form of the watershed’s built form, the resulting water quality conditions, and the ecosystem services urban streams provide for people. This background also leverages many different methodologies in my work, including data science, hydrological models, social science methods, and so on. In addition, the most important thing about my research journey is that I have a few excellent friends/researchers who help me a lot on my way and make my research life inspiring and delightful most of the time. Accomplishments and Awards 2021 Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) Grant Award: Data Science Approach towards a Socio-ecological Framework for the Investigation of Continental Urban Stream Water Quality Pattern My research focuses on novel biomedical imaging and treatment technologies, especially those involving light and ultrasound. I have extensive experience in medical system development, laser-tissue interactions, ultrasound tissue characterization, and adaptation of novel technologies to preclinical and clinical settings. A major part of my research is the development and clinical applications of photoacoustic imaging technology. By working on small-animal models and human patients, I have been seeking for clinical applications of this exciting technology to inflammatory arthritis, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, eye diseases, osteoporosis, and brain disorders. Besides photoacoustic imaging, I am also interested in development of other medical imaging and treatment technologies, such as ionizing radiation induced acoustic imaging (iRAI) and photo-mediated ultrasound therapy (PUT). As the PI or co-Investigator of several NIH, NSF and DoD-funded research, I have successfully administered the projects, collaborated with other researchers, and produced high-quality publications. My contribution to biomedical optics and ultrasound up to now including over 160 peer-reviewed journal papers is a solid evidence of my creativity and ability to surmount the challenges in this field. I received the Sontag Foundation Fellow of the Arthritis National Research Foundation in 2005, the Distinguished Investigator Award of the Academy of Radiology Research in 2013, and was elected as the fellow of AIMBE in 2020 and the fellow of SPIE in 2022. What is your most interesting project? Automated photoacoustic imaging of inflammatory arthritis: Our research has demonstrated the unique capability of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in diagnosis and treatment monitoring of inflammatory arthritis. The new physiological and molecular biomarkers of synovitis presented by PAI can help in characterizing disease onset, progression, and response to therapy. Based on the endogenous optical contrast, PAI is extremely sensitive to the changes in hemodynamic properties in inflammatory joint tissues (e.g. enhanced flow and hypoxia). We are now conducting a preclinical research on patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis. The initial findings from this patient study are promising and suggest that the new optical contrast and physiological information introduced by PAI could greatly enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of diagnostic imaging and treatment monitoring of arthritis. Aiming at clinical translation, we are currently developing a point-of-care PAI and ultrasound dual-modality imaging system which is fully automated when powered by a robot and AI technologies. Ionizing radiation acoustic imaging (iRAI) for personalized radiation therapy: iRAI, as a brand-new imaging technology relying on the detection of radiation-induced acoustic waves, allows online monitoring of radiation’s interactions with tissues during radiation therapy, providing real-time, adaptive feedback for cancer treatments. We are developing an iRAI volumetric imaging system that enables mapping of the three-dimensional (3D) radiation dose distribution in a complex clinical radiotherapy treatment. The feasibility of imaging temporal 3D dose accumulation was first validated in studies on phantoms and animal models. Then, real-time visualization of the 3D radiation dose delivered to a patient with liver metastases was accomplished with a clinical linear accelerator. These studies demonstrate the great potential of iRAI to monitor and quantify the 3D radiation dose deposition during treatment, potentially improving radiotherapy treatment efficacy using real-time adaptive treatment.

Develop and translate state-of-the-art medical imaging and treatment technologies. What makes you excited about your data science and AI research? Date science and AI is super important in developing state-of-the-art medical imaging and treatment technologies, especially for achieving personalized diagnosis and treatment ensuring largely improved patient outcome. As mentioned in the above, the automated imaging system for rheumatology/radiology clinic for arthritis imaging would be strongly powered by AI, which is crucial to achieve our goal of a “smart” ultrasound imaging platform. My research interests are in causal inference, randomized clinical trials, clustered data and their interactions with infectious disease research. In my research, data analysis is the core, and I use semi-parametric models and machine learning algorithms to draw statistical inference, make predictions, and quantify uncertainties. Dr. Xhabija joined the Department of Natural Sciences in September 2022 as an Assistant Professor of Biochemistry. Her laboratory aims to understand the effects of toxins on early embryonic development utilizing embryonic stem cells because they provide a new tool and opportunity to investigate the impact of environmental exposures and their interactions with genetic factors on human development and health. To fully realize these potentials, she believes that it is important to understand the molecular basis of the defining characteristic of the stem cells. More specifically, she is interested in investigating how stem cells play a role in shaping the expression program during development and how mechanisms of self-renewal and differentiation during mammalian development regulate cellular fate decisions. Xiaoling Xiang conducts community-based services research concerning the physical and mental health and service use of diverse older populations. She is particularly interested in psychosocial approaches to promoting mental health and enhancing the quality of life in older adults. Her other areas of research include the epidemiology of mental disorders in late life, comorbidity, quality of home and community-based services, and implementation of evidence-based interventions. She uses a variety of applied statistical methods in the analysis of data from national surveys, electronic medical records, insurance claims. My research focuses on developing and applying computational and data-enabled methodology in the broader area of sustainability. Main thrusts are as follows: Human mobility dynamics. I am interested in mining large-scale real-world travel trajectory data to understand human mobility dynamics. This involves the processing and analyzing travel trajectory data, characterizing individual mobility patterns, and evaluating environmental impacts of transportation systems/technologies (e.g., electric vehicles, ride-sharing) based on individual mobility dynamics. Global supply chains. Increasingly intensified international trade has created a connected global supply chain network. I am interested in understanding the structure of the global supply chain network and economic/environmental performance of nations. Networked infrastructure systems. Many infrastructure systems (e.g., power grid, water supply infrastructure) are networked systems. I am interested in understanding the basic structural features of these systems and how they relate to the system-level properties (e.g., stability, resilience, sustainability). A network visualization (force-directed graph) of the 2012 US economy using the industry-by-industry Input-Output Table (15 sectors) provided by BEA contains 405 industries. Each node represents a sector. The size of the node represents the economic output of the sector. The size and darkness of links represent the value of exchanges of goods/services between sectors.

Using big data analytics to measure value-added contributions of nurses Accomplishments and Awards Here’s Why Nurses Are Exiting Healthcare Study: Black patients less likely to get home health care referral than white peers My research program at the University of Michigan (UM) integrates the fields of biophysics, quantitative systems biology, and bottom-up synthetic biology to understand complex stochastic cellular and developmental processes in early embryos. We have developed innovative computational and experimental techniques in microfluidics and imaging to allow high-throughput quantitative manipulation and single-cell lineage tracking of cellular spatiotemporal dynamical processes in various powerful in vitro and in vivo systems we established in my lab. These systems range from cell-free extracts, synthetic cells reconstituted in microemulsion droplets, presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and progenitor zone (PZ) cells dissociated from the zebrafish tail buds, their re-aggregated 2D and 3D cell-cell communications, ex vivo live tissue explants, and live embryos. Our current research questions center around the understanding of the design-function relation of robust biological timing, growth, and patterning, how individual molecules and cells communicate to generate collective patterns, and how biochemical, biophysical, and biomechanical signals work together to shape morphogenesis during early embryo development. Dr. X. Jessie Yang is an Associate Professor in the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, with courtesy appointments at the School of Information. She is an expert in human-autonomy/robot interaction, particularly in modeling trust in human-autonomy teams. She and her team use machine learning tools to model human behaviors when interacting with autonomous and robotic agents. Dr. Yarbasi’s expertise lies in uncertainty quantification for complex systems, verification and validation (V&V) processes, robotics, energy systems modeling within smart building infrastructures, and systems engineering. Prior to joining U-M, he collaborated extensively with government and industry on a range of projects, including the development of a surgical endoscopy robot and the energy optimization of a net-zero-energy building. He worked with international experts on a NATO STO project to create a validation database for simulation environments in air and sea vehicle design. His dissertation expanded this work by developing a comprehensive methodology to identify critical uncertainties in complex multidisciplinary designs and guide experimentation to mitigate these uncertainties. Dr. Yarbasi’s research interests are born out of a deep passion for data and its potential to drive innovation in engineering. He leverages data-intensive methodologies to enhance the performance and safety of autonomous vehicles, smart city infrastructure, and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) systems. By applying data analytics, machine learning, and optimization techniques, he aims to develop transportation systems that are efficient, reliable, sustainable, and responsive to real-time conditions. The focus of our research is to address (1) how neuronal development contributes to the assembly and function of the nervous system, and (2) how defects in this process lead to brain disorders. We take a multidisciplinary approach that include genetics, cell biology, developmental biology, biochemistry, advanced imaging (for neuronal structures and activity), electrophysiology, computation (including machine learning and computer vision) and behavioral studies. We are currently studying the neural basis for decision accuracy. We established imaging and computational methods for analyzing neural activities in the entire central nervous system (CNS) of the Drosophila larva. Moreover, we are exploring the possibility of applying the biological neural algorithms to robotics for testing these algorithms and for improving robot performance. A major goal of neuroscience is to understand the neural basis for behavior, which requires accurate and efficient quantifications of behavior. To this end, we recently developed a software tool—named LabGym—for automatic identification and quantification of user-defined behavior through artificial intelligence. This tool is not restricted to a specific species or a set of behaviors. The updated version (LabGym2) can analyze social behavior and behavior in dynamic backgrounds. We are further developing LabGym and other computational tools for behavioral analyses in wild animals and in medicine. The behavior that this chipmunk performed was identified and quantified by LabGym, an AI-based software tool that the Ye lab developed for quantifying user-defined behaviors. What are some of your most interesting projects? 1) Develop AI-based software tools for analyzing the behavior of wild animals and human. 2) Use biology-inspired robotics to test biological neural algorithms. How did you end up where you are today? Since my teenage years, I have been curious about how brains (human’s and animals’) work, enjoyed playing with electronics, and learning about computational sciences. My curiosity and opportunities led me to become a neuroscientist. When I had my own research team and the resources to explore my other interests, I started to build simple electronic devices for my neuroscience research and to collaborate with computational scientists who are experts in machine learning and computer vision. My lab now combines these approaches in our neuroscience research. What makes you excited about your data science and AI research? I am very excited about the interactions between neuroscience and data science/AI research. This is a new area and has great potential of changing the society. My research interests include the analysis, modeling, design and optimization of transportation systems towards achieving sustainability and economic efficiency. My ongoing research involves investigating the implications of emerging technologies on mobility services and systems. I closely follow the development of new technologies, such as smart mobile devices and apps, sensoring technologies, electric vehicles, drones, and connected and automated vehicles, and examine how they could potentially affect both the demand and supply sides of transportation systems, and then explore how to leverage these new technologies to better design, operate and manage transportation systems and improve the efficiency, reliability, safety, and diversity of the transportation services. Beyond transportation, Dr. Yin also studies the interdependency of urban infrastructure systems such as transportation, power and communications networks. Lei Ying’s research is broadly in the interplay of complex stochastic systems and big-data, including large-scale communication/computing systems for big-data processing, private data marketplaces, and large-scale graph mining. Amy M. Yorke, PT, PhD, NCS, is Assistant Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of Michigan, Flint. My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, human vision, and machine learning. Visual perception presents not just a fascinating computational problem, but more importantly an intelligent solution for large-scale data mining and pattern recognition applications. My research has thus three themes. 1. Actionable Representation Learning Driven by Natural Data. I attribute our fast effortless vision to actionable representation learning driven by natural data, where mid-level visual pieces can be reassembled and adapted for seeing the new. 2. Efficient Structure-Aware Machine Learning Models. I view a computational model as dual to the data it takes in; since visual data are full of structures, models reflective of such structures can achieve maximum efficiency. 3. Application to Science, Medicine, and Engineering. I am interested in applying computer vision and machine learning to capture and exceed human expertise, enabling automatic data-driven discoveries in science, medicine, and engineering. YZ’s research can be summarized into two words: Matter and Machine. On the Matter side, his group studies far-from-equilibrium physics. They synergistically combine and push the boundaries of statistical and stochastic thermodynamic theories, accelerated molecular simulations, understandable AI/ML/DS methods, and neutron scattering experiments, with the goal of significantly extending our understanding of a wide range of long timescale phenomena and rare events. Particular emphasis is given to the physics and chemistry of liquids and complex fluids, especially at interfaces, driven away from equilibrium, or under extreme conditions. On the Machine side, leveraging their expertise in materials and modeling, his group advances the development of soft robots and human-compatible machines, swarm robots and collective intelligence, and robots in extreme environments, which can lead to immediate societal impact. • Matter o Far-from-equilibrium physics, long timescale phenomena, and rare events (statistical and stochastic thermodynamic theories, accelerated molecular simulations, understandable AI/ML/DS methods) o Neutron scattering, sources, and instrumentation o Physics and chemistry of liquids and complex fluids, especially under interfacial/non-equilibrium/extreme conditions (water, metallic liquids, molten salts, ionic liquids, electrolyte solutions) • Machine o Soft robots and human-compatible machines o Swarm robots and collective intelligence o Robots in extreme environments Much of our work focuses on host-parasite coevolution both computationally using populations of self-replicating computer programs (sort of like computer viruses), and experimentally in the lab with bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophage). But that’s not all! We’re deeply interdisciplinary, and broadly interested in ecology and evolution. While I often approach questions from an experimentalist’s perspective, work in our lab relies on a mixture of computational, mathematical, and microbial systems. I am predominantly drawn to understanding host-parasite coevolution because the constant push-and-pull of antagonistic interactions emphasizes the dynamic and interdependent nature of biological evolution. These antagonistic interactions have been implicated in some fascinating large-scale evolutionary patterns, such as diversification, sexual reproduction, and increasing organismal complexity. Studying these processes using open-ended computational systems means generating, analyzing, and visualizing copious amounts of multidimensional data. Jon Zelner, PhD, is Assistant Professor in the department of Epidemiology in the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Dr. Zelner holds a second appointment in the Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health. Dr. Zelner’s research is focused on using spatial analysis, social network analyisis and dynamic modeling to prevent infectious diseases, with a focus on tuberculosis and diarrheal disease. Jon is also interested in understanding how the social and biological causes of illness interact to generate observable patterns of disease in space and in social networks, across outcomes ranging from infection to mental illness. A large spatial cluster of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases in Lima, Peru is highlighted in red. A key challenge in my work is understanding why these cases cluster in space: can social, spatial, and genetic data tell us where transmission is occurring and how to interrupt it? Our work is interdisciplinary in nature and we connect three fields, chemistry, physics and materials science. Our goal is to develop theoretical tools that give access to directly experimentally relevant quantities. We develop and apply codes that describe two types of electronic motion (i) weakly correlated electrons originating from the delocalized “wave-like” s- and p-orbitals responsible for many electron correlation effects in molecules and solids that do not contain transition metal atoms (ii) strongly correlated electrons residing in the d- and f-orbitals that remain localized and behave “particle-like” responsible for many very interesting effects in the molecules containing d- and f-electrons (transition metal nano-particles used in catalysis, nano-devices with Kondo resonances and molecules of biological significance – active centers of metalloproteins). The mutual coupling of these two types of electronic motion is challenging to describe and currently only a few theories can properly account for both types of electronic correlation effects simultaneously. Available research projects in the group involve (1) working on a new theory that is able to treat weakly and strongly correlated electrons in molecules with multiple transition metal centers with applications to molecular magnets and active centers of enzymes (2) developing a theory for weakly correlated electrons that is able to produce reliable values of band gaps in semiconductors and heterostructures used in solar cells industry (3) applying the QM/QM embedding theories developed in our group to catalysis on transition metal-oxide surfaces and (4) applying the embedding formalism to molecular conductance problems in order to include correlation effects. Jun Zhang, PhD, is Professor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Prof. Zhang develops algebraic and geometric methods for data analysis. Algebraic methods are based on theories of topology and partially ordered sets (in particular lattice theory); an example being formal concept analysis (FCA). Geometric methods include Information Geometry, which studies the manifold of probability density functions. He interests include mathematical psychology and computational neuroscience, broadly defined to include neural network theory and reinforcement learning, dynamical analysis of nervous system (single neuron activity and event-related potential), computational vision, choice-reaction time model, Bayesian decision theory and game theory. I develop computational methods to study conversations. I am interested in study how conversationalists use language to do things with and to each other, and how they navigate often-challenging interactions. I’m particularly interested in settings where people have conversations on behalf of institutions, and in analyzing conversations as a window into how these institutions work in practice. Drawing on techniques from natural language processing, computational social science, and causal inference, I examine large datasets containing conversation transcripts. Past and present work has considered settings such as political discourse, mental health counseling, and law enforcement. Additional Information What are some of your most interesting projects?

My previous work focused on exploring spatial-temporal diversities in Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) for its improved communication performance and enabled sensing/localization. My vision is that light can provide the secure and location-aware communication for Internet-of-Things and human-centered mobile computing. With explored OWC’s spatial-temporal diversities and machine learning, we can use light as promising medium for next-generation wireless networks with broad applications (e.g., LiFi, V2X networks, underwater navigation, digital health, smart city, HCI, and AR/VR). Some of my projects are detailed below. （1） HoloCube is an innovative optical wireless communication (OWC) system designed to enable 3D Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity using software-defined optical camera communication and the Pepper’s Ghost effect. Unlike conventional OWC systems that treat the transmitter as a point source, HoloCube employs virtual 3D hollow cubes with adaptive Spatial-Color Shift Keying (SCSK) modulation. These cubes maintain a consistent structure when viewed from different angles while dynamically embedding distinct data over time. The cube’s positioning elements provide dual references for 3D reconstruction (spatial) and robust color decoding (spectral). Experimental results demonstrate that HoloCube achieves reliable omnidirectional IoT connections with a goodput of 70 Kbps over a 4-meter range in real-world indoor settings, offering an efficient and secure solution for mobile IoT applications. (2) RoFin is an innovative system designed for real-time 3D hand pose reconstruction, leveraging six temporal-spatial 2D rolling fingertips for precise tracking of 20 hand joints. Unlike traditional vision-based approaches limited by low sampling rates (60 Hz), poor performance in low-light conditions, and restricted detection ranges, RoFin uses active optical labeling for finger identification and high rolling shutter rates (5-8 KHz) to enhance 3D location tracking. Implemented with wearable gloves featuring low-power LED nodes and commercial cameras, RoFin demonstrates significant advancements in human-computer interaction (HCI), including applications like multi-user interfaces and virtual writing for Parkinson’s patients. Experiments show RoFin achieves an 85% labeling accuracy at distances up to 2.5 meters, improves tracking granularity with 4× more sampled points per frame, and reconstructs hand poses with a mean deviation error of just 16 mm compared to Leap Motion. We’ve applied various ML models for our projects such as CycleGAN for underwater image denoising, omnidirectional localization, user ID identification, etc. The most significant scientific contribution I would like to make is in exploring light as a medium for ubiquitous wireless communication and sensing by utilizing AI and IoT technologies. I am working on analyzing the solar wind plasma measurements obtained by multiple space missions. Especially, I am interested in the solar wind heavy ion elemental abundance and charge states measured by SWICS on Ulysses and ACE and HIS onboard Solar Orbiter mission. Applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms on solar wind plasma classification and heliophysics parameter prediction are a brand new research area that we have been working on.

My research is focused on developing efficient and effective statistical and computational methods for genetic and genomic studies. These studies often involve large-scale and high-dimensional data; examples include genome-wide association studies, epigenome-wide association studies, and various functional genomic sequencing studies such as bulk and single cell RNAseq, bisulfite sequencing, ChIPseq, ATACseq etc. Our method development is often application oriented and specifically targeted for practical applications of these large-scale genetic and genomic studies, thus is not restricted in a particular methodology area. Our previous and current methods include, but are not limited to, Bayesian methods, mixed effects models, factor analysis models, sparse regression models, deep learning algorithms, clustering algorithms, integrative methods, spatial statistics, and efficient computational algorithms. By developing novel analytic methods, I seek to extract important information from these data and to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation for various human diseases and disease related quantitative traits. A statistical method recently developed in our group aims to identify tissues that are relevant to diseases or disease related complex traits, through integrating tissue specific omics studies (e.g. ROADMAP project) with genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Heatmap displays the rank of 105 tissues (y-axis) in terms of their relevance for each of the 43 GWAS traits (x-axis) evaluated by our method. Traits are organized by hierarchical clustering. Tissues are organized into ten tissue groups . Accomplishments and Awards Five mid-career researchers receive Biosciences Initiative award For human-machine systems, I first collect data from human users, whether it’s an individual, a team, or even a society. Different kinds of methods can be used, including self-report, interview, focus groups, physiological and behavioral data, as well as user-generated data from the Internet. Based on the data collected, I attempt to understand human contexts, including different aspects of the human users, such as emotion, cognition, needs, preferences, locations and activities. Such understanding can then be applied to different human-machine systems, including healthcare systems, automated driving systems, and product-service systems. Based on the different design theory and methodology, from the perspective of the machine dimension, I apply knowledge of computing and communication as well as practical and theoretical knowledge of social and behavior to design various systems for human users. From the human dimension, I seek to understand human needs and decision making processes, and then build mathematical models and design tools that facilitate integration of subjective experiences, social contexts, and engineering principles into the design process of human-machine systems. With a passion for developing decision support systems that integrate cutting edge techniques from artificial intelligence, quantitative image analysis, computer vision, and multimodal biomedical data fusion. Research interests have been focusing on characterizing diseases abnormalities and predicting their likelihood of being significant, with the goal to enable early diagnosis and risk stratification, as well as aiding treatment decision making and monitoring. My main research activities address the fundamental challenges of machine learning when applied to real-world applications. My research theme is to develop generalizable, scalable, interpretable, and privacy-preserving approaches that can effectively mine insights from big data and validate and incorporate such insights in application domains, especially health informatics. My long-term research vision is to achieve Unified Knowledge Integration: enhancing health informatics using artificial intelligence to consolidate domain knowledge and the insights derived from large-scale, multimodal, and heterogeneous datasets and curated knowledge in foundation models.
